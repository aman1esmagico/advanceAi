    "text": "MSLHello Dr Lewis, can you see me, ok? (WAVES) DrHello, yes I can. (WAVES BACK) MSLCan I just check who else we have in the meeting please? DRYes, of course, does everyone want to introduce   themselves? JDrHi, I’m Julie one of the junior doctors working alongside Dr Lewis at the moment. MSLGreat to meet you Julie, can I ask what stage you’re at in your training? JDrSure, I’m an F2 so still pretty early on. MSLWell it’s great to meet you, thanks for joining the meeting. NSHi, I’m Sally the Lung Specialist Nurse. MSLBrilliant, lovely to meet you Sally. Thanks for introducing yourselves, are we expecting anyone else? DRI don’t think so. MSLGreat, thank you. Let me introduce myself, I’m Laurence from Pharmapro and  I am here in response to a medical request you made through my colleague Louise.  I would like to take you through the data regarding Avant which is licensed in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced or locally advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer that have progressed following first line treatment with platinum chemotherapy. Is that what you were expecting this meeting to be about? DRYes, that’s what I was hoping for! MSLExcellent, my aim is that by the end of the presentation I will have provided you with the information you need to support your treatment decisions for your patients. I am keen to answer any questions you may have so do please ask questions as we go through the data. DrGreat, thanks MSLDid any of you get the opportunity to attend the virtual ASCO meeting last month? DrYes, I did, it was a really great meeting MSLFantastic, I got to attend several of the sessions myself and was really impressed with the data and advancements in patient care that I saw. DrYes, I really enjoy ASCO as there is always so much great content. MSLWhat presentation stood out for you? DrSo many of them to be honest but the ones I found most interesting were the ones with the new biomarkers, it’s incredible how much we are discovering now in terms of targets for treatment and indicators for disease. MSLI know, it’s incredible and so promising for patients and clinicians alike.  Did you attend any of the presentations about Avant or ELC testing? DrYes, you couldn’t really miss it, there seemed to be a lot of studies being presented on both the drug and the testing. MSLYeah, there’s a significant level of interest in exploring what both the treatment and the test can offer lung cancer patients who have advanced disease, as you know, these patients can be very challenging to manage.  Can I ask what you remember from the presentations you observed? DrOf course, I know that your phase 3 study showed an improvement in progression free survival as well as overall survival and I understand that the particular protein the drug targets … sorry I can’t remember the name of the protein, but the protein is present in over 50% of patients – is that correct? MSLFantastic, it sounds like you have a good handle on the key elements, can I just ask your colleagues how much they know about Avant?  Julie?  Sally? JDrI have to admit I know very little about this treatment, so I am looking forward to learning from you. NSI have heard bits and bobs and I know as a team we are looking to start testing so it would be helpful to know a bit more. MSLOk, great, well if this works for you, I propose that I take you through the data and the testing set up and then we can leave some time for any questions you may have, should take about 15 minutes, does that sound ok? DrPerfect, thank you. MSLCan I ask what discussions you have had to date with the other consultants about it? DrWell after ASCO, I brought it up at a recent MDT meeting we had. MSLWas that in relation to a specific patient you were discussing? DrNo, not really MSLOk, just a general conversation about treatment options? Dr (NODS) Yeah, pretty much. MSLIn terms of the testing element, what information are you looking for specifically? Dr(SCRATCHES HEAD/THINKS) Best method of testing for the protein and the sensitivity of the test are both important to know. ******************************** MSL(NODS) Ok, I have a few slides on that here. As you may be aware, it’s a simple immunohistochemistry test you just need access to the antibody. Dr(SITS FORWARD) Where do we get the antibody from? MSLYou can order it direct from the company. DrDo we need a special testing kit? MSLYou can purchase an ELC ready-to-use assay, I have a leaflet I can leave on that showing the details. Dr Will the pathologists understand all of this? MSLYes, they should be very familiar with these types of tests. Dr Ok, so what are the tissue requirements to be able to perform the test? MSLThat’s a good question.  As you know tissue is difficult to get in lung cancer cases and the requirements in terms of size of sample is not that high, it is more important that the sample contains as many cancer cells as possible. DrSo any sample is better than nothing in terms of size? MSLI think in the discovery phase, as you build your experience, it would make sense to test as many samples as possible.  It might be worth speaking to your pathologists to check, but I would imagine their expectations in terms of tissue sample would be similar across the board. DrWell I suppose so, I guess we always try to get a good sample. MSLIn terms of the cut offs, they looked at whether a sample contained 25, 50 or 75% positive tumour cells and it was deemed that the ELC expression was high if the sample contained greater than 50% of cells expressing the protein.  Which means that if 50% or more of the cancer cells in the sample expresses the protein then the drug should work. DrDoes that mean, we would only use Avant in those patients who have 50% or greater expression? MSLYes, that’s correct. DrWhat percentage of patients would you expect to have 50% ELC expression in their tumours? MSLThe current data, which I am showing on the screen, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Professor Sykes in 2018, suggests up to 65% of advanced or locally advanced non-small cell tumours may have some expression of ELC, the level of expression within the individuals is not yet known which is why everyone who could be eligible for treatment should be tested. DrOk, I see.  Do you need to re-biopsy when they progress? MSLThe data supports use of either material from the initial biopsy or from a second biopsy following progression, as it’s difficult to get tissue for the initial diagnosis, I imagine it must be even harder the second time round.  Do you re-biopsy many patients at progression? Dr We do if we can, just in case the cancer has mutated, but it’s not always possible. MSLYes, we hear from a lot of clinicians that getting access to good tissue samples is particularly challenging. Dr It can be, we do a lot of EBUS at this hospital, are cytology samples ok to use? MSL If they can be formalin fixed into a block and sliced then yes DrOk, I think that’s what they do with them, maybe another one for me to check with the pathologists. (MAKES A NOTE) MSLIf you would like me to support with any of the information you want to discuss with the pathologists then please let me know. DrYes, I might need some support, will see how I get on first. MSLOk, so that’s it in terms of the test, is there any other information you would like to know on that matter? DrI don’t think so, sounds like I need to speak to the pathologists first. MSLNo problem, and as I said I can support with any information if you need me to. NSWe have a meeting with Dr Williamson (the pathologist) at the end of the week, would you like me to add it to the agenda? DrYes please Sally, that would be great. DrAre you able to send me those slides you have? MSLThese ones on the detail around the testing requirements? DrYes, then I could forward them on to Dr Williamson MSLYes, that’s no problem at all, I can do that. DrThanks. MSLWhen you have introduced a new diagnostic test previously, what process did you follow to ensure it was integrated with minimal disruption to the turn around times of results? DrTo be honest, the pathologists do most of that, we just let them know which patients need testing when we have the MDT meeting. MSLOk, I see, whilst I understand that the pathologists take the lead on it, is there anything that you would improve about the process you currently have for identifying which patients require which diagnostic test? DrTo be honest, it works pretty well, I do think we should be quicker at adopting new tests though. MSLIs there anything specific you think that could be done? (LEANS FORWARD) DrProbably not, a lot of it comes down to funding within the trust and getting things through approval. MSLThat is similar in every trust to be honest. DrYes, I think it is a standard issue. (NODS IN AGREEMENT) MSLShall we have a look at the data now? Dr Yes please MSLIs there anything particular any of you would like me to focus on? DrAn overview of the phase 3 trial would be useful for me. NSI’d be keen to understand what side effects we are likely to see and how to manage them please. MSLOf course, we can certainly cover that. Can everyone see the title slide with the study name on it? Dr/JDr/NS Yes (all together) MSLThe phase 3 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, and multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of Avant in combination with Docetaxel as second line therapy in patients with advanced or locally advanced NSCLC following first line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary outcomes measured were progression free survival and overall survival and the secondary outcome measured was change in patient reported outcomes. Can you tell me what the title of the slide is that you can see on the screen? DrInclusion/Exclusion Criteria MSLGreat, well as you can see, these were in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as you can see patients in the study had all progressed after 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. There were 602 patients in the study randomised to one of two arms. Any patients who had received any other systemic treatment for their cancer other than the platinum-based chemo were excluded from the study. The results are now showing on the screen and were as follows: Objective response rate = 45% vs 21%, progression free survival = 6.3 months vs 2.1 months and overall survival of 12.1 months vs 9.6 months. You can see on the graph here, the separation of the curves and a hazard ratio of 0.7 In terms of the patient recorded outcomes when looking at cough, chest pain, fatigue, and loss of appetite.  Participants reported on average a 25% improvement in symptom scores across all measures. What stands out for you in that data? DrIt’s certainly encouraging outcomes NSI’m pleased to see the improvement in symptom scores, for these patients, quality of life is so important. MSLAbsolutely, it’s important that we look at the impact on patients’ lives as well as the efficacy of the treatment. DrCould you just remind of the dosing again? MSLCertainly, let me just pull the dosing slide up for you, can you see that?  The dose, is weight dependent and is an infusion, but the treatment schedule is as follows: Avant + Docetaxel every 3 weeks or Placebo + Docetaxel every 3 weeks Dr So you say its weight based, what’s the calculation? MSLIts 0.2mg/kg DrAnd how often is that given? MSLIt’s given on Day 1 of each 3-weekly cycle alongside Docetaxel. DrSally, can you make a note of that for the nurses on the chemo suite? NSYes, no problem at all. Do you have the Adverse Events information you can show? MSLYes, of course, let me just pull the slide up…. Can you see the slide entitled Treatment Emergent Adverse Events? NSYes, we can see that. MSLPerfect, antibody drug conjugates tend to be well tolerated because they deliver the cytotoxic payload into the tumour cell meaning that very little goes into the healthy tissue, however like any treatment there are side effects.  What this slide shows you is the incidence of each of the reported adverse events, is there anything particular that stands out for you? NSEmmmm….  It actually looks like it’s generally well tolerated…  I’m quite surprised.  Are there any particular things we need to consider to mitigate the risks? MSLNot particularly, just the usual supportive treatments you would use for patients with this stage cancer. NSOk, great, thank you. MSLIs there anything else you would like me to show you in terms of the data? DrNo, I think we have enough there to be going on with. MSLGreat, so in terms of next steps, how do you plan to take this forward as a team? DrI think we will discuss it again at the MDT, I also need to catch up with Dr Williamson to discuss the pathology set up. MSLWhat additional information or support do you need from me? DrI think it would be good if you could send me the slides you have shown us today so I can reference them when discussing with ym colleagues. MSLOf course, would you be interested in signing up to our Clinical Paper Portal which would give you access to all the clinical studies for Avant? DrThat sounds helpful, what would I need to do? MSLIf you’re happy for me to pass your email address on to my colleague in our Medical Information department they will create you an account and send you the link. DrYes, that would be great, thank you. MSLI also note from the registrations that you have signed up to our upcoming webinar “The Evolution of Treatments for Advanced Lung Cancer”.  Sally, Julie – would you like me to send you the information on the webinar? JDrYes please, that would be interesting. NSSure, I’ll take a look. MSLDr Lewis – the webinar will focus on some case studies that are developing, is this something you might be interested in being involved in? DrI might be, I’d need to know a bit more. MSLWould it be ok to reach out to you after the webinar to discuss in more depth? DrYes, that would be fine. MSLOk, well I’m conscious of time, I will send out the webinar information and get Dr Lewis set up on the clinical paper portal.  I know you have plans to speak to your pathologist and the wider team, please do let me know if you need any support with that. DrWill do, many thanks MSLYour welcome, look forward to speaking with you all again. ALLBye, thanks, bye etc…",

    "text": "RE:Hi, Tracey. Nice to see you again. HCP:Hi. RE:How are you? HCP:Yes, really good, thanks, Rachael. How are you? Nice to see you. RE:I’m very well, thank you. Thank you for meeting with me today. RE:Remind me, Tracey, I understand from Partridge Health that you’re looking to repatriate your CCPs, so I was hoping today if we could just chat about that a little bit and just ask you a few questions about that, if that’d be okay? HCP:Yes, of course. Yes. RE:Great. So before I go into that, I just wanted to do a little bit more of a background to the lab. So with your instrument set-up at the moment, what instruments do you have in immunology at the moment? HCP:In immunology, obviously we’ve got the Optimed 360, just the one of those. RE:So with the CCPs, Tracey, what’s your workload at the moment? How many are you doing a day, roughly? HCP:A day? Gosh, I think current workload is about 250 a month that we’re sending away. RE:And so you’re sending them away to Partridge at the moment, and what analyser do they run them on? HCP:They’re using the Biovance automated system, so they just pop them on and they’re tracked and the turnaround times are really rapid, which is fantastic. RE:So in terms of bringing them back in house then, in a perfect world, how would you like to see the service set-up for  your CCPs here? How would you like to run them, do you think? HCP:I think the main plan is, because we also have automation downstairs, there is the Biovance tracking system, and therefore it’s a good crossover, it minimises the comparison we need to do as we’re using that test already, we’re kind of used to the results, and, in-house, all we have to do is a minor validation of the methods to see that we’re producing similar results. RE:I see, so turnaround times are key really for you? HCP:Yes, seven days for CCPs. RE:Seven days, currently, okay. So with the Optimed 360 at the moment, are you running that every day? HCP:Yes, most days. RE:And how often do you run the EliA IgG method? HCP:That’s pretty much every day, for a variety of tests. RE:So what would you say, then, if we could look at, say, for example, running your CCPs three times a day? Because am I right in thinking that CCP testing, it’s not classed as urgent, per se? HCP:No, that’s why it’s got quite a generous turnaround time compared to MPA, PR3s and things like that. RE:With it being continuous loading, we could have the EliA IgG method set up every day, and maybe you could prioritise three days but know that you’ve got the leeway, and then you can feed the samples through every day, and you would still be comfortably within your seven-day turnaround. HCP:Sure. One thing though, what’s the first time to result for those? RE:I want to say it’s about an hour and a half, but I’m not entirely sure. Funny you say that, actually, I’ve got a brochure that talks about the process time and shows a schematic, but I don’t actually have any with me, so sorry about that, but I could maybe get one to you. But that shows quite nicely the time to first result. So still comfortably within your working day, and working during the three days per week for CCPs, you would be within your turnaround time. HCP:Okay, yes. If you could forward that on, that’d be really handy, please. RE:Yes. So does that sounds like something that would work in terms of doing CCP three times a day, do you think that would fit? HCP:Yes, I think, at this stage, depending on costs, etc., it’s worth thinking about, definitely. RE:And then, what would be involved in that, Tracey, in terms of if you wanted to consider looking at them on the Optimed 360? HCP:Well, obviously you know we’ve never got enough staff and there’s never enough time, is there any way you could give us some support with an evaluation? Because if we were going to do a Biovance evaluation, it would be minimal, whereas if we were considering the 360, it would be a substantially larger study. So… RE:Yes, I’m sure we could sort something out for you, that’s no problem. Leave that with me. HCP:Okay, thank you. RE:So that’s really great. I’ve got a good understanding of what you’re looking to achieve. So perhaps maybe the next step would be we could arrange another meeting and we can talk about it again in a little bit more detail. Does that sound okay? HCP:Yes, absolutely. ******************************** RE:We can always come back. HCP:Yes. RE:Yes, that’d be really helpful, but thank you for today, that’s really useful to know where you are and what you’re looking to achieve, and yes, we can come back and talk about it again.

    "segments": "[\"RE:Hi, Tracey. Nice to see you again. HCP:Hi. RE:How are you? HCP:Yes, really good, thanks, Rachael. How are you? Nice to see you. RE:I\\u2019m very well, thank you. Thank you for meeting with me today. RE:Remind me, Tracey, I understand from Partridge Health that you\\u2019re looking to repatriate your CCPs, so I was hoping today if we could just chat about that a little bit and just ask you a few questions about that, if that\\u2019d be okay? HCP:Yes, of course. Yes. RE:Great. So before I go into that, I just wanted to do a little bit more of a background to the lab. So with your instrument set-up at the moment, what instruments do you have in immunology at the moment? HCP:In immunology, obviously we\\u2019ve got the Optimed 360, just the one of those. RE:So with the CCPs, Tracey, what\\u2019s your workload at the moment? How many are you doing a day, roughly? HCP:A day? Gosh, I think current workload is about 250 a month that we\\u2019re sending away. RE:And so you\\u2019re sending them away to Partridge at the moment, and what analyser do they run them on? HCP:They\\u2019re using the Biovance automated system, so they just pop them on and they\\u2019re tracked and the turnaround times are really rapid, which is fantastic. RE:So in terms of bringing them back in house then, in a perfect world, how would you like to see the service set-up for your CCPs here? How would you like to run them, do you think? HCP:I think the main plan is, because we also have automation downstairs, there is the Biovance tracking system, and therefore it\\u2019s a good crossover, it minimises the comparison we need to do as we\\u2019re using that test already, we\\u2019re kind of used to the results, and, in-house, all we have to do is a minor validation of the methods to see that we\\u2019re producing similar results. RE:I see, so turnaround times are key really for you? HCP:Yes, seven days for CCPs. RE:Seven days, currently, okay. So with the Optimed 360 at the moment, are you running that every day? HCP:Yes, most days. RE:And how often do you run the EliA IgG method? HCP:That\\u2019s pretty much every day, for a variety of tests. RE:So what would you say, then, if we could look at, say, for example, running your CCPs three times a day? Because am I right in thinking that CCP testing, it\\u2019s not classed as urgent, per se? HCP:No, that\\u2019s why it\\u2019s got quite a generous turnaround time compared to MPA, PR3s and things like that. RE:With it being continuous loading, we could have the EliA IgG method set up every day, and maybe you could prioritise three days but know that you\\u2019ve got the leeway, and then you can feed the samples through every day, and you would still be comfortably within your seven-day turnaround. HCP:Sure. One thing though, what\\u2019s the first time to result for those? RE:I want to say it\\u2019s about an hour and a half, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure. Funny you say that, actually, I\\u2019ve got a brochure that talks about the process time and shows a schematic, but I don\\u2019t actually have any with me, so sorry about that, but I could maybe get one to you.

DR:   Yes, of course, does everyone want to introduce   themselves? JDr:  Hi, I’m Julie one of the junior doctors working alongside Dr Lewis at the moment. MSL:Great to meet you Julie, can I ask what stage you’re at in your training? JDr:  Sure, I’m an F2 so still pretty early on. MSL:Well it’s great to meet you, thanks for joining the meeting. NS:   Hi, I’m Sally the Lung Specialist Nurse. MSL:Brilliant, lovely to meet you Sally. Thanks for introducing yourselves, are we expecting anyone else? DR:   I don’t think so. MSL:Great, thank you. Let me introduce myself, I’m Laurence from Pharmapro and  I am here in response to a medical request you made through my colleague Louise.  I would like to take you through the data regarding Avant which is licensed in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced or locally advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer that have progressed following first line treatment with platinum chemotherapy. Is that what you were expecting this meeting to be about? DR:   Yes, that’s what I was hoping for! MSL:Excellent, my aim is that by the end of the presentation I will have provided you with the information you need to support your treatment decisions for your patients. I am keen to answer any questions you may have so do please ask questions as we go through the data. Dr:    Great, thanks MSL:Did any of you get the opportunity to attend the virtual ASCO meeting last month? Dr:    Yes, I did, it was a really great meeting MSL:Fantastic, I got to attend several of the sessions myself and was really impressed with the data and advancements in patient care that I saw. Dr:    Yes, I really enjoy ASCO as there is always so much great content. MSL:What presentation stood out for you? Dr:    So many of them to be honest but the ones I found most interesting were the ones with the new biomarkers, it’s incredible how much we are discovering now in terms of targets for treatment and indicators for disease. MSL:I know, it’s incredible and so promising for patients and clinicians alike.  Did you attend any of the presentations about Avant or ELC testing? Dr:    Yes, you couldn’t really miss it, there seemed to be a lot of studies being presented on both the drug and the testing. MSL:Yeah, there’s a significant level of interest in exploring what both the treatment and the test can offer lung cancer patients who have advanced disease, as you know, these patients can be very challenging to manage.  Can I ask what you remember from the presentations you observed? Dr:    Of course, I know that your phase 3 study showed an improvement in progression free survival as well as overall survival and I understand that the particular protein the drug targets … sorry I can’t remember the name of the protein, but the protein is present in over 50% of patients – is that correct? MSL:Fantastic, it sounds like you have a good handle on the key elements, can I just ask your colleagues how much they know about Avant?  Julie?  Sally? JDr:  I have to admit I know very little about this treatment, so I am looking forward to learning from you. NS:   I have heard bits and bobs and I know as a team we are looking to start testing so it would be helpful to know a bit more. MSL:Ok, great, well if this works for you, I propose that I take you through the data and the testing set up and then we can leave some time for any questions you may have, should take about 15 minutes, does that sound ok? Dr:    Perfect, thank you. MSL:Can I ask what discussions you have had to date with the other consultants about it? Dr:    Well after ASCO, I brought it up at a recent MDT meeting we had. MSL:Was that in relation to a specific patient you were discussing? Dr:    No, not really MSL:Ok, just a general conversation about treatment options? Dr:    (NODS) Yeah, pretty much. MSL:In terms of the testing element, what information are you looking for specifically? Dr:    (SCRATCHES HEAD/THINKS) Best method of testing for the protein and the sensitivity of the test are both important to know. MSL:(NODS) Ok, I have a few slides on that here. ::  As you may be aware, it’s a simple immunohistochemistry test you just need access to the antibody. Dr:    (SITS FORWARD) Where do we get the antibody from? MSL:You can order it direct from the company. Dr:    Do we need a special testing kit? MSL:You can purchase an ELC ready-to-use assay, I have a leaflet I can leave on that showing the details. Dr:    Will the pathologists understand all of this? MSL:Yes, they should be very familiar with these types of tests. Dr:    Ok, so what are the tissue requirements to be able to perform the test? MSL:That’s a good question.  As you know tissue is difficult to get in lung cancer cases and the requirements in terms of size of sample is not that high, it is more important that the sample contains as many cancer cells as possible. Dr:    So any sample is better than nothing in terms of size? MSL:I think in the discovery phase, as you build your experience, it would make sense to test as many samples as possible.  It might be worth speaking to your pathologists to check, but I would imagine their expectations in terms of tissue sample would be similar across the board. Dr:    Well I suppose so, I guess we always try to get a good sample. MSL:In terms of the cut offs, they looked at whether a sample contained 25, 50 or 75% positive tumour cells and it was deemed that the ELC expression was high if the sample contained greater than 50% of cells expressing the protein.  Which means that if 50% or more of the cancer cells in the sample expresses the protein then the drug should work. Dr:    Does that mean, we would only use Avant in those patients who have 50% or greater expression? MSL:Yes, that’s correct. Dr:    What percentage of patients would you expect to have 50% ELC expression in their tumours? MSL:The current data, which I am showing on the screen, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Professor Sykes in 2018, suggests up to 65% of advanced or locally advanced non-small cell tumours may have some expression of ELC, the level of expression within the individuals is not yet known which is why everyone who could be eligible for treatment should be tested. Dr:    Ok, I see.  Do you need to re-biopsy when they progress? MSL:The data supports use of either material from the initial biopsy or from a second biopsy following progression, as it’s difficult to get tissue for the initial diagnosis, I imagine it must be even harder the second time round.  Do you re-biopsy many patients at progression? Dr:    We do if we can, just in case the cancer has mutated, but it’s not always possible. MSL:Yes, we hear from a lot of clinicians that getting access to good tissue samples is particularly challenging. Dr:    It can be, we do a lot of EBUS at this hospital, are cytology samples ok to use? MSL If they can be formalin fixed into a block and sliced then yes Dr:    Ok, I think that’s what they do with them, maybe another one for me to check with the pathologists. (MAKES A NOTE) MSL:If you would like me to support with any of the information you want to discuss with the pathologists then please let me know. Dr:    Yes, I might need some support, will see how I get on first. MSL:Ok, so that’s it in terms of the test, is there any other information you would like to know on that matter? Dr:    I don’t think so, sounds like I need to speak to the pathologists first. MSL:No problem, and as I said I can support with any information if you need me to. NS:   We have a meeting with Dr Williamson (the pathologist) at the end of the week, would you like me to add it to the agenda? Dr:    Yes please Sally, that would be great. Dr:    Are you able to send me those slides you have? MSL:These ones on the detail around the testing requirements? Dr:    Yes, then I could forward them on to Dr Williamson MSL:Yes, that’s no problem at all, I can do that. Dr:    Thanks. MSL:When you have introduced a new diagnostic test previously, what process did you follow to ensure it was integrated with minimal disruption to the turn around times of results? Dr:    To be honest, the pathologists do most of that, we just let them know which patients need testing when we have the MDT meeting. MSL:Ok, I see, whilst I understand that the pathologists take the lead on it, is there anything that you would improve about the process you currently have for identifying which patients require which diagnostic test? Dr:    To be honest, it works pretty well, I do think we should be quicker at adopting new tests though. MSL:Is there anything specific you think that could be done? (LEANS FORWARD) Dr:    Probably not, a lot of it comes down to funding within the trust and getting things through approval. MSL:That is similar in every trust to be honest. Dr:    Yes, I think it is a standard issue. (NODS IN AGREEMENT) MSL:Shall we have a look at the data now? Dr:    Yes please MSL:Is there anything particular any of you would like me to focus on? Dr:    An overview of the phase 3 trial would be useful for me. NS:   I’d be keen to understand what side effects we are likely to see and how to manage them please. MSL:Of course, we can certainly cover that. Can everyone see the title slide with the study name on it? Dr/JDr/NS Yes (all together) MSL:The phase 3 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, and multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of Avant in combination with Docetaxel as second line therapy in patients with advanced or locally advanced NSCLC following first line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary outcomes measured were progression free survival and overall survival and the secondary outcome measured was change in patient reported outcomes. Can you tell me what the title of the slide is that you can see on the screen? Dr:    Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria MSL:Great, well as you can see, these were in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as you can see patients in the study had all progressed after 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. There were 602 patients in the study randomised to one of two arms. Any patients who had received any other systemic treatment for their cancer other than the platinum-based chemo were excluded from the study. The results are now showing on the screen and were as follows: Objective response rate = 45% vs 21%, progression free survival = 6.3 months vs 2.1 months and overall survival of 12.1 months vs 9.6 months. You can see on the graph here, the separation of the curves and a hazard ratio of 0.7 In terms of the patient recorded outcomes when looking at cough, chest pain, fatigue, and loss of appetite.  Participants reported on average a 25% improvement in symptom scores across all measures. What stands out for you in that data? Dr:    It’s certainly encouraging outcomes NS:   I’m pleased to see the improvement in symptom scores, for these patients, quality of life is so important. MSL:Absolutely, it’s important that we look at the impact on patients’ lives as well as the efficacy of the treatment. Dr:    Could you just remind of the dosing again? MSL:Certainly, let me just pull the dosing slide up for you, can you see that?  The dose, is weight dependent and is an infusion, but the treatment schedule is as follows: Avant + Docetaxel every 3 weeks or Placebo + Docetaxel every 3 weeks Dr:    So you say its weight based, what’s the calculation? MSL:Its 0.2mg/kg Dr:    And how often is that given? MSL:It’s given on Day 1 of each 3-weekly cycle alongside Docetaxel. Dr:    Sally, can you make a note of that for the nurses on the chemo suite? NS:   Yes, no problem at all. ::  Do you have the Adverse Events information you can show? MSL:Yes, of course, let me just pull the slide up…. ::  Can you see the slide entitled Treatment Emergent Adverse Events? NS:   Yes, we can see that. MSL:Perfect, antibody drug conjugates tend to be well tolerated because they deliver the cytotoxic payload into the tumour cell meaning that very little goes into the healthy tissue, however like any treatment there are side effects.  What this slide shows you is the incidence of each of the reported adverse events, is there anything particular that stands out for you? NS:   Emmmm….  It actually looks like it’s generally well tolerated…  I’m quite surprised.  Are there any particular things we need to consider to mitigate the risks? MSL:Not particularly, just the usual supportive treatments you would use for patients with this stage cancer. NS:   Ok, great, thank you. MSL:Is there anything else you would like me to show you in terms of the data? Dr:    No, I think we have enough there to be going on with. MSL:Great, so in terms of next steps, how do you plan to take this forward as a team? Dr:    I think we will discuss it again at the MDT, I also need to catch up with Dr Williamson to discuss the pathology set up. MSL:What additional information or support do you need from me? Dr:    I think it would be good if you could send me the slides you have shown us today so I can reference them when discussing with ym colleagues. MSL:Of course, would you be interested in signing up to our Clinical Paper Portal which would give you access to all the clinical studies for Avant? Dr:    That sounds helpful, what would I need to do? MSL:If you’re happy for me to pass your email address on to my colleague in our Medical Information department they will create you an account and send you the link. Dr:    Yes, that would be great, thank you. MSL:I also note from the registrations that you have signed up to our upcoming webinar “The Evolution of Treatments for Advanced Lung Cancer”.  Sally, Julie – would you like me to send you the information on the webinar? JDr:  Yes please, that would be interesting. NS:   Sure, I’ll take a look. MSL:Dr Lewis – the webinar will focus on some case studies that are developing, is this something you might be interested in being involved in? Dr:    I might be, I’d need to know a bit more. MSL:Would it be ok to reach out to you after the webinar to discuss in more depth? Dr:    Yes, that would be fine. MSL:Ok, well I’m conscious of time, I will send out the webinar information and get Dr Lewis set up on the clinical paper portal.  I know you have plans to speak to your pathologist and the wider team, please do let me know if you need any support with that. Dr:    Will do, many thanks MSL:Your welcome, look forward to speaking with you all again. ALL: Bye, thanks, bye etc…",

MSL:Excellent, my aim is that by the end of the presentation I will have provided you with the information you need to support your treatment decisions for your patients.

MSL:Was that in relation to a specific patient you were discussing? Dr:    No, not really MSL:Ok, just a general conversation about treatment options? Dr:    (NODS) Yeah, pretty much. MSL:In terms of the testing element, what information are you looking for specifically? Dr:    (SCRATCHES HEAD/THINKS) Best method of testing for the protein and the sensitivity of the test are both important to know. MSL:(NODS) Ok, I have a few slides on that here. ::  As you may be aware, it’s a simple immunohistochemistry test you just need access to the antibody. Dr:    (SITS FORWARD) Where do we get the antibody from? MSL:You can order it direct from the company. Dr:    Do we need a special testing kit? MSL:You can purchase an ELC ready-to-use assay, I have a leaflet I can leave on that showing the details. Dr:    Will the pathologists understand all of this? MSL:Yes, they should be very familiar with these types of tests. Dr:    Ok, so what are the tissue requirements to be able to perform the test? MSL:That’s a good question.  As you know tissue is difficult to get in lung cancer cases and the requirements in terms of size of sample is not that high, it is more important that the sample contains as many cancer cells as possible. Dr:    So any sample is better than nothing in terms of size? MSL:I think in the discovery phase, as you build your experience, it would make sense to test as many samples as possible.  It might be worth speaking to your pathologists to check, but I would imagine their expectations in terms of tissue sample would be similar across the board. Dr:    Well I suppose so, I guess we always try to get a good sample. MSL:In terms of the cut offs, they looked at whether a sample contained 25, 50 or 75% positive tumour cells and it was deemed that the ELC expression was high if the sample contained greater than 50% of cells expressing the protein.  Which means that if 50% or more of the cancer cells in the sample expresses the protein then the drug should work. Dr:    Does that mean, we would only use Avant in those patients who have 50% or greater expression? MSL:Yes, that’s correct. Dr:    What percentage of patients would you expect to have 50% ELC expression in their tumours? MSL:The current data, which I am showing on the screen, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Professor Sykes in 2018, suggests up to 65% of advanced or locally advanced non-small cell tumours may have some expression of ELC, the level of expression within the individuals is not yet known which is why everyone who could be eligible for treatment should be tested. Dr:    Ok, I see.  Do you need to re-biopsy when they progress? MSL:The data supports use of either material from the initial biopsy or from a second biopsy following progression, as it’s difficult to get tissue for the initial diagnosis, I imagine it must be even harder the second time round.  Do you re-biopsy many patients at progression? Dr:    We do if we can, just in case the cancer has mutated, but it’s not always possible. MSL:Yes, we hear from a lot of clinicians that getting access to good tissue samples is particularly challenging. Dr:    It can be, we do a lot of EBUS at this hospital, are cytology samples ok to use? MSL If they can be formalin fixed into a block and sliced then yes Dr:    Ok, I think that’s what they do with them, maybe another one for me to check with the pathologists. (MAKES A NOTE) MSL:If you would like me to support with any of the information you want to discuss with the pathologists then please let me know. Dr:    Yes, I might need some support, will see how I get on first. MSL:Ok, so that’s it in terms of the test, is there any other information you would like to know on that matter? Dr:    I don’t think so, sounds like I need to speak to the pathologists first. MSL:No problem, and as I said I can support with any information if you need me to. NS:   We have a meeting with Dr Williamson (the pathologist) at the end of the week, would you like me to add it to the agenda? Dr:    Yes please Sally, that would be great. Dr:    Are you able to send me those slides you have? MSL:These ones on the detail around the testing requirements? Dr:    Yes, then I could forward them on to Dr Williamson MSL:Yes, that’s no problem at all, I can do that. Dr:    Thanks. MSL:When you have introduced a new diagnostic test previously, what process did you follow to ensure it was integrated with minimal disruption to the turn around times of results? Dr:    To be honest, the pathologists do most of that, we just let them know which patients need testing when we have the MDT meeting. MSL:Ok, I see, whilst I understand that the pathologists take the lead on it, is there anything that you would improve about the process you currently have for identifying which patients require which diagnostic test? Dr:    To be honest, it works pretty well, I do think we should be quicker at adopting new tests though. MSL:Is there anything specific you think that could be done? (LEANS FORWARD) Dr:    Probably not, a lot of it comes down to funding within the trust and getting things through approval. MSL:That is similar in every trust to be honest. Dr:    Yes, I think it is a standard issue. (NODS IN AGREEMENT) MSL:Shall we have a look at the data now? Dr:    Yes please MSL:Is there anything particular any of you would like me to focus on? Dr:    An overview of the phase 3 trial would be useful for me. NS:   I’d be keen to understand what side effects we are likely to see and how to manage them please. MSL:Of course, we can certainly cover that. Can everyone see the title slide with the study name on it? Dr/JDr/NS Yes (all together) MSL:The phase 3 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, and multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of Avant in combination with Docetaxel as second line therapy in patients with advanced or locally advanced NSCLC following first line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary outcomes measured were progression free survival and overall survival and the secondary outcome measured was change in patient reported outcomes. Can you tell me what the title of the slide is that you can see on the screen? Dr:    Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria MSL:Great, well as you can see, these were in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as you can see patients in the study had all progressed after 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. There were 602 patients in the study randomised to one of two arms. Any patients who had received any other systemic treatment for their cancer other than the platinum-based chemo were excluded from the study. The results are now showing on the screen and were as follows: Objective response rate = 45% vs 21%, progression free survival = 6.3 months vs 2.1 months and overall survival of 12.1 months vs 9.6 months. You can see on the graph here, the separation of the curves and a hazard ratio of 0.7 In terms of the patient recorded outcomes when looking at cough, chest pain, fatigue, and loss of appetite.  Participants reported on average a 25% improvement in symptom scores across all measures. What stands out for you in that data? Dr:    It’s certainly encouraging outcomes NS:   I’m pleased to see the improvement in symptom scores, for these patients, quality of life is so important. MSL:Absolutely, it’s important that we look at the impact on patients’ lives as well as the efficacy of the treatment. Dr:    Could you just remind of the dosing again? MSL:Certainly, let me just pull the dosing slide up for you, can you see that?  The dose, is weight dependent and is an infusion, but the treatment schedule is as follows: Avant + Docetaxel every 3 weeks or Placebo + Docetaxel every 3 weeks Dr:    So you say its weight based, what’s the calculation? MSL:Its 0.2mg/kg Dr:    And how often is that given? MSL:It’s given on Day 1 of each 3-weekly cycle alongside Docetaxel. Dr:    Sally, can you make a note of that for the nurses on the chemo suite? NS:   Yes, no problem at all. ::  Do you have the Adverse Events information you can show? MSL:Yes, of course, let me just pull the slide up…. ::  Can you see the slide entitled Treatment Emergent Adverse Events? NS:   Yes, we can see that. MSL:Perfect, antibody drug conjugates tend to be well tolerated because they deliver the cytotoxic payload into the tumour cell meaning that very little goes into the healthy tissue, however like any treatment there are side effects.  What this slide shows you is the incidence of each of the reported adverse events, is there anything particular that stands out for you? NS:   Emmmm….  It actually looks like it’s generally well tolerated…  I’m quite surprised.  Are there any particular things we need to consider to mitigate the risks? MSL:Not particularly, just the usual supportive treatments you would use for patients with this stage cancer. NS:   Ok, great, thank you. MSL:Is there anything else you would like me to show you in terms of the data? Dr:    No, I think we have enough there to be going on with. MSL:Great, so in terms of next steps, how do you plan to take this forward as a team? Dr:    I think we will discuss it again at the MDT, I also need to catch up with Dr Williamson to discuss the pathology set up. MSL:What additional information or support do you need from me? Dr:    I think it would be good if you could send me the slides you have shown us today so I can reference them when discussing with ym colleagues. MSL:Of course, would you be interested in signing up to our Clinical Paper Portal which would give you access to all the clinical studies for Avant? Dr:    That sounds helpful, what would I need to do? MSL:If you’re happy for me to pass your email address on to my colleague in our Medical Information department they will create you an account and send you the link. Dr:    Yes, that would be great, thank you. MSL:I also note from the registrations that you have signed up to our upcoming webinar “The Evolution of Treatments for Advanced Lung Cancer”.  Sally, Julie – would you like me to send you the information on the webinar? JDr:  Yes please, that would be interesting. NS:   Sure, I’ll take a look. MSL:Dr Lewis – the webinar will focus on some case studies that are developing, is this something you might be interested in being involved in? Dr:    I might be, I’d need to know a bit more. MSL:Would it be ok to reach out to you after the webinar to discuss in more depth? Dr:    Yes, that would be fine. MSL:Ok, well I’m conscious of time, I will send out the webinar information and get Dr Lewis set up on the clinical paper portal.  I know you have plans to speak to your pathologist and the wider team, please do let me know if you need any support with that. Dr:    Will do, many thanks MSL:Your welcome, look forward to speaking with you all again. ALL: Bye, thanks, bye etc…",
    "segments": "[\"MSL:Hello Dr Lewis, can you see me, ok? (WAVES) Dr: Hello, yes I can. (WAVES BACK) MSL:Can I just check who else we have in the meeting please? DR: Yes, of course, does everyone want to introduce themselves? JDr: Hi, I\\u2019m Julie one of the junior doctors working alongside Dr Lewis at the moment. MSL:Great to meet you Julie, can I ask what stage you\\u2019re at in your training? JDr: Sure, I\\u2019m an F2 so still pretty early on. MSL:Well it\\u2019s great to meet you, thanks for joining the meeting. NS: Hi, I\\u2019m Sally the Lung Specialist Nurse. MSL:Brilliant, lovely to meet you Sally. Thanks for introducing yourselves, are we expecting anyone else? DR: I don\\u2019t think so. MSL:Great, thank you. Let me introduce myself, I\\u2019m Laurence from Pharmapro and I am here in response to a medical request you made through my colleague Louise. I would like to take you through the data regarding Avant which is licensed in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced or locally advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer that have progressed following first line treatment with platinum chemotherapy. Is that what you were expecting this meeting to be about? DR: Yes, that\\u2019s what I was hoping for! MSL:Excellent, my aim is that by the end of the presentation I will have provided you with the information you need to support your treatment decisions for your patients. I am keen to answer any questions you may have so do please ask questions as we go through the data. Dr: Great, thanks MSL:Did any of you get the opportunity to attend the virtual ASCO meeting last month? Dr: Yes, I did, it was a really great meeting MSL:Fantastic, I got to attend several of the sessions myself and was really impressed with the data and advancements in patient care that I saw. Dr: Yes, I really enjoy ASCO as there is always so much great content. MSL:What presentation stood out for you? Dr: So many of them to be honest but the ones I found most interesting were the ones with the new biomarkers, it\\u2019s incredible how much we are discovering now in terms of targets for treatment and indicators for disease. MSL:I know, it\\u2019s incredible and so promising for patients and clinicians alike. Did you attend any of the presentations about Avant or ELC testing? Dr: Yes, you couldn\\u2019t really miss it, there seemed to be a lot of studies being presented on both the drug and the testing. MSL:Yeah, there\\u2019s a significant level of interest in exploring what both the treatment and the test can offer lung cancer patients who have advanced disease, as you know, these patients can be very challenging to manage. Can I ask what you remember from the presentations you observed? Dr: Of course, I know that your phase 3 study showed an improvement in progression free survival as well as overall survival and I understand that the particular protein the drug targets \\u2026 sorry I can\\u2019t remember the name of the protein, but the protein is present in over 50% of patients \\u2013 is that correct? MSL:Fantastic, it sounds like you have a good handle on the key elements, can I just ask your colleagues how much they know about Avant? Julie? Sally? JDr: I have to admit I know very little about this treatment, so I am looking forward to learning from you. NS: I have heard bits and bobs and I know as a team we are looking to start testing so it would be helpful to know a bit more. MSL:Ok, great, well if this works for you, I propose that I take you through the data and the testing set up and then we can leave some time for any questions you may have, should take about 15 minutes, does that sound ok?

    "text": "HCP Morning, Lukas/ Birgit. Good to see you. HCP-P Morning Dr Kinski. Good to see you too. How are you? HCP I’m good, thanks for asking, busy as always but otherwise good. HCP-P Ah, busy is a way of life these days, isn’t it? HCP It certainly is! HCP-P Well thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I know we discussed GABODERM last time we met, and we covered some of the basics, but I really believe it’s an outstanding drug that could be life changing for the right patients. Could we revisit your adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis please? I’d love you to have the confidence to want to try GABODERM in one of these patients if that is okay with you? HCP Yes, of course. HCP-P Last time we met, you mentioned that you were one of the first to try secretamab and it had become one of your routine treatments for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. HCP Yes, that’s right. HCP-P Could you tell me what was it that triggered you to try it for the first time and what did you see that made you decide to make it one of your mainstay treatments? HCP Well, let me think. I seem to remember it was one of the first new treatments we had for plaque psoriasis for years, and we’d not really had anything that effective. We had to try a whole gamut of treatments in combination to achieve any kind of significant improvement for patients, emollients, steroids, UV. So, when I saw the data for secretamab, it was outstanding and compared to what we’d experienced before, I just had to try it. From there, it lived up to my, kind of reserved expectations and I was truly amazed. It’s been a mainstay ever since. HCP-P Thank you, for sharing that. There have been other new products launched in this area since, but you don’t seem to have adopted any of those, what would a new treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis have to demonstrate for you to have that “I must try it” moment again? HCP It really has to offer something significant in terms of efficacy. Clear space between it and secretamab. HCP-P And when you say efficacy, what would that be for you? PASI 90, speed, what exactly for you? HCP With secretamab it was initially PASI 90, it was just so far out ahead of what we had at the time. Otherwise, the things I’m looking for are initial speed of action and sustained effectiveness, I don’t want it waring off in other words. HCP-P Okay, so if I want you to have that “I must try it” moment again, I need to demonstrate efficacy, PASI 90 and if possible significant improvements over current treatment. Speed of action and that it will not ware off over time. Is that correct? HCP Yes if you can do that I’ll be impressed. HCP-P Okay, I think I can, let me show you the RADIANT Study. Now, although this is a UCB sponsored study, it was peer reviewed and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2021. It was a head to head, double-blind randomised study of 743 moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients compared to secretamab, which you have been routinely using. It this okay to present? HCP Yes, it’s not very often we get new drugs compared to something we routinely use, so yes I’m very interested to see what it says. HCP-P Well, here the Y-axis shows the percentage of patients achieving PASI 90 and the X-axis shows the number of weeks of treatment. What you can see is that GABODERM moves ahead of secretamab quite early and by week 4, 34.9% of patients have achieved PASI 90 compared to just 17.5% of the secretamab group. Any comments yet? HCP Not yet, please carry on. HCP-P The separation is maintained and significant, the P-Value was less than zero point zero zero one! So, achieves really good PASI 90 and has significant superiority to secretamab, the speed of action shows separation early and is significant at week 4 and the efficacy is maintained over time as you can see. No waring off. Also, as you can see a high percentage of patients respond excellently to GABODERM. What do you think now? HCP I think. I think I probably should try it. HCP-P That’d be great. HCP So, it does raise a few questions, how do I prescribe and administer GABODERM and is there anything I need to be aware of. You know, side effects, etc. HCP-P So, ideally, we’d suggest using it in a biologic naïve patient, so you can see just how good it is and… HCP I’m not sure I’d use it for the first time in a biologic naïve patient, but I do have a couple in mind who’ve been struggling on their current biologics. HCP-P Okay, that’s great. So, how to prescribe and administer. HCP-P It’s an initial 5 doses, similar to other biologics and then switching to an 8 week interval for maintenance. Overall, it’s eight less than secretamab in the first year and less on an ongoing basis, which patients will love. HCP Well that’s easy.

HCP-P Similar to the others, apart from you may see candidiasis in up to 1 in 8 patients, but it’s transient and can be treated with a simple antifungal. In the studies, we saw very few people stop treatment due to this. HCP Okay, that all seems very straight forward. HCP-P Do you have a patient in mind and how will you ensure they receive GABODERM? HCP I do have someone in mind, but I know they’re not due in for a couple of weeks. Also, although I’ll see the patient, it’ll be the nurse that administers the first dose and has responsibility for training the patient. HCP-P Well, could we book a meeting for you to meet the nurse and ensure she has everything she needs to start that patient on GABODERM? HCP Yes, let’s do that. HCP-P Excellent, also, it’s important for you to see how well GABODERM works if it’s going to become one of your routine treatments. Could, we book another meeting a couple of weeks after the patient commences treatment so we can check the patients progress? I really want you to see how fast GABODERM works.

    "segments": "[\"HCP Morning, Lukas/ Birgit. Good to see you. HCP-P Morning Dr Kinski. Good to see you too. How are you? HCP I\\u2019m good, thanks for asking, busy as always but otherwise good. HCP-P Ah, busy is a way of life these days, isn\\u2019t it? HCP It certainly is! HCP-P Well thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I know we discussed GABODERM last time we met, and we covered some of the basics, but I really believe it\\u2019s an outstanding drug that could be life changing for the right patients. Could we revisit your adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis please? I\\u2019d love you to have the confidence to want to try GABODERM in one of these patients if that is okay with you? HCP Yes, of course. HCP-P Last time we met, you mentioned that you were one of the first to try secretamab and it had become one of your routine treatments for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. HCP Yes, that\\u2019s right. HCP-P Could you tell me what was it that triggered you to try it for the first time and what did you see that made you decide to make it one of your mainstay treatments? HCP Well, let me think. I seem to remember it was one of the first new treatments we had for plaque psoriasis for years, and we\\u2019d not really had anything that effective. We had to try a whole gamut of treatments in combination to achieve any kind of significant improvement for patients, emollients, steroids, UV. So, when I saw the data for secretamab, it was outstanding and compared to what we\\u2019d experienced before, I just had to try it. From there, it lived up to my, kind of reserved expectations and I was truly amazed. It\\u2019s been a mainstay ever since. HCP-P Thank you, for sharing that. There have been other new products launched in this area since, but you don\\u2019t seem to have adopted any of those, what would a new treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis have to demonstrate for you to have that \\u201cI must try it\\u201d moment again? HCP It really has to offer something significant in terms of efficacy. Clear space between it and secretamab. HCP-P And when you say efficacy, what would that be for you? PASI 90, speed, what exactly for you? HCP With secretamab it was initially PASI 90, it was just so far out ahead of what we had at the time. Otherwise, the things I\\u2019m looking for are initial speed of action and sustained effectiveness, I don\\u2019t want it waring off in other words. HCP-P Okay, so if I want you to have that \\u201cI must try it\\u201d moment again, I need to demonstrate efficacy, PASI 90 and if possible significant improvements over current treatment. Speed of action and that it will not ware off over time. Is that correct? HCP Yes if you can do that I\\u2019ll be impressed. HCP-P Okay, I think I can, let me show you the RADIANT Study. Now, although this is a UCB sponsored study, it was peer reviewed and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2021. It was a head to head, double-blind randomised study of 743 moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients compared to secretamab, which you have been routinely using. It this okay to present? HCP Yes, it\\u2019s not very often we get new drugs compared to something we routinely use, so yes I\\u2019m very interested to see what it says. HCP-P Well, here the Y-axis shows the percentage of patients achieving PASI 90 and the X-axis shows the number of weeks of treatment. What you can see is that GABODERM moves ahead of secretamab quite early and by week 4, 34.9% of patients have achieved PASI 90 compared to just 17.5% of the secretamab group. Any comments yet? HCP Not yet, please carry on. HCP-P The separation is maintained and significant, the P-Value was less than zero point zero zero one! So, achieves really good PASI 90 and has significant superiority to secretamab, the speed of action shows separation early and is significant at week 4 and the efficacy is maintained over time as you can see. No waring off. Also, as you can see a high percentage of patients respond excellently to GABODERM. What do you think now? HCP I think. I think I probably should try it. HCP-P That\\u2019d be great. HCP So, it does raise a few questions, how do I prescribe and administer GABODERM and is there anything I need to be aware of. You know, side effects, etc. HCP-P So, ideally, we\\u2019d suggest using it in a biologic na\\u00efve patient, so you can see just how good it is and\\u2026 HCP I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019d use it for the first time in a biologic na\\u00efve patient, but I do have a couple in mind who\\u2019ve been struggling on their current biologics. HCP-P Okay, that\\u2019s great. So, how to prescribe and administer. HCP-P It\\u2019s an initial 5 doses, similar to other biologics and then switching to an 8 week interval for maintenance. Overall, it\\u2019s eight less than secretamab in the first year and less on an ongoing basis, which patients will love. HCP Well that\\u2019s easy. HCP-P It comes in a handy autoinjector, so patients can do this themselves at home, once you\\u2019ve trained them. HCP Excellent, and side effects. HCP-P Similar to the others, apart from you may see candidiasis in up to 1 in 8 patients, but it\\u2019s transient and can be treated with a simple antifungal.

It was a head to head, double-blind randomised study of 743 moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients compared to secretamab, which you have been routinely using. It this okay to present? HCP Yes, it\\u2019s not very often we get new drugs compared to something we routinely use, so yes I\\u2019m very interested to see what it says. HCP-P Well, here the Y-axis shows the percentage of patients achieving PASI 90 and the X-axis shows the number of weeks of treatment. What you can see is that GABODERM moves ahead of secretamab quite early and by week 4, 34.9% of patients have achieved PASI 90 compared to just 17.5% of the secretamab group. Any comments yet? HCP Not yet, please carry on. HCP-P The separation is maintained and significant, the P-Value was less than zero point zero zero one! So, achieves really good PASI 90 and has significant superiority to secretamab, the speed of action shows separation early and is significant at week 4 and the efficacy is maintained over time as you can see. No waring off. Also, as you can see a high percentage of patients respond excellently to GABODERM. What do you think now? HCP I think. I think I probably should try it. HCP-P That\\u2019d be great. HCP So, it does raise a few questions, how do I prescribe and administer GABODERM and is there anything I need to be aware of. You know, side effects, etc. HCP-P So, ideally, we\\u2019d suggest using it in a biologic na\\u00efve patient, so you can see just how good it is and\\u2026 HCP I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019d use it for the first time in a biologic na\\u00efve patient, but I do have a couple in mind who\\u2019ve been struggling on their current biologics. HCP-P Okay, that\\u2019s great. So, how to prescribe and administer. HCP-P It\\u2019s an initial 5 doses, similar to other biologics and then switching to an 8 week interval for maintenance. Overall, it\\u2019s eight less than secretamab in the first year and less on an ongoing basis, which patients will love. HCP Well that\\u2019s easy. HCP-P It comes in a handy autoinjector, so patients can do this themselves at home, once you\\u2019ve trained them. HCP Excellent, and side effects. HCP-P Similar to the others, apart from you may see candidiasis in up to 1 in 8 patients, but it\\u2019s transient and can be treated with a simple antifungal. In the studies, we saw very few people stop treatment due to this. HCP Okay, that all seems very straight forward. HCP-P Do you have a patient in mind and how will you ensure they receive GABODERM? HCP I do have someone in mind, but I know they\\u2019re not due in for a couple of weeks. Also, although I\\u2019ll see the patient, it\\u2019ll be the nurse that administers the first dose and has responsibility for training the patient. HCP-P Well, could we book a meeting for you to meet the nurse and ensure she has everything she needs to start that patient on GABODERM? HCP Yes, let\\u2019s do that. HCP-P Excellent, also, it\\u2019s important for you to see how well GABODERM works if it\\u2019s going to become one of your routine treatments. Could, we book another meeting a couple of weeks after the patient commences treatment so we can check the patients progress? I really want you to see how fast GABODERM works. HCP DIARIES COMPLETED AND DATE AGREED Yes, let\\u2019s book that when you come in to see the nurse. HCP-P Excellent. I\\u2019ll see you then\"]",
