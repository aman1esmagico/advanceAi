# Speaker 0    00:00:02    I last saw Dr. Shine two months ago. Uh, he has more recently attended the webcast with Dr. Mystery where data on the mode of action was presented for bra. There has been an increase in market share in the account over the last six months. The last time I saw Dr. Shine, um, he hadn't prescribed any bra there currently eight patients on bra on the, in the account. My understanding is that it was, um, Dr. Kline who initiated them based on my discussions with Catherine, the nurse specialist, who I saw last week, there is a formulary application in process that has been initiated by Dr. Kline, however, can be prescribed for exceptional cases or on compassionate grants. Currently in this trust during previous calls, um, Dr. Shine has said that he prefers to continue with the more established drugs that he is used to, uh, from previous experience Dr. Speaker 0    00:01:00    Shine, he, he isn't an innovator when it comes to new treatments. He has said in previous interactions that he is cautious when prescribing very new treatments. Um, mental health is on the CC agenda at the moment. Um, Dr. Shine has previously talked about the anxiety and depression that his younger adults suffer from due to their condition. I am keen to focus on this group of patients during our call today, I would place, uh, Dr. Shine as, as no commitment to the product on the commitment continuum as he is not prescribed the drug. And hasn't identified any suitable patients yet regarding the priority reason for choosing bra is the efficacy and data. Uh, I have heard the customers say, um, my decision at this time is to maintain the current therapy for these patients. So I will be aiming for him to comment along the lines of the data you have shared with me is interesting and robust. Speaker 0    00:02:04    Uh I'm to use the, for this interaction. Uh, this is the first time I've done this with Dr. Shine. So I've already sent him an ensure that he has Chrome on his computer, whether or not he has access to AAM and step by step instructions on how access the remote call. I've also sent him the engage link as calendar invite, and I will ensure I'm on the platform 15 minutes prior to the call so that I am ready for him. Um, I'm currently, uh, working at home. I will make sure I have no distractions, uh, kids, dogs, uh, that my environment is, uh, well lit. Um, and we can clutter, I will make sure I have a glass of water and my notes to hand so that I'm prepared for the full interaction. Um, my plan for this interaction is to discuss the impact that severe psoriasis has on the younger patient group and the impact that this has on their quality of life. Speaker 0    00:03:07    And self-esteem, I'm keen to understand Dr. Shine's views on this. I plan to present the data on, on the efficacy of bra and gain agreement that this is this directly correlates to increased quality of life scores in this younger patient cohort. By the end of the engagement, I would like for Dr. Shine to have a good understanding of the data and that bra could be a good choice for his younger patients with severe psoriasis and, and to get him to agree to trialing it. I, in a patient terribly failing on our topical treatment, my fullback objective will be for him to identify a way in which to recognize that rather patient when they walk through the door of the clinic within the next month as this is the first time I'm engaging with Dr. Shine through the BVA engage platform. I, I will firstly ensure that, that he can see and hear me clearly. Speaker 0    00:04:05    Um, I will introduce myself and remind him of our previous interactions. I will explore his level of comfort in using the technology for our virtual engagement, focusing on his interactions with, uh, family, uh, friends, work colleagues, uh, I'll be any technical issue. He may have such as his camera being off or, um, sound muted. I will confirm how long he has available for this interaction and outline my agenda, being really clear the action I want, uh, aim to get from him today. It's to identify younger patient where he can trial bra to begin to gain experience with it. I, I will also, um, ask if Dr has any specific topics he would like to discuss with me in the time that we have together. I plan to review with Dr. His views on bra and his reflections and takeaways from the webcast. It will be important for me to focus the, and the clinical we have specifically looking at efficacy and the benefits that has on a patient's quality of life due to the or mental health and the younger patient cohort in this I Dr. Speaker 0    00:05:22    S experience in this patient group, uh, I'll be looking for signals, uh, to know how comfortable, uh, to know he is comfortable and advise him that I will check in regularly to see what he is seeing on his screen. I'm keen to understand Dr. Sharon's views on Braddon following the webcast. It will be important for me to then discuss of a patient and understand what he is looking for in the treatment for this group. Uh, I will use a variety of questions to gain an understanding of his needs and the areas within the data, uh, to present to him. Um, questions like, um, in the past, uh, when you've successfully changed from using Nora to how did you make that decision, um, and what needs to, for you to be able to consider trialing bran and your patients? Um, what would it, Speaker 1    00:06:24    Uh, look like Speaker 0    00:06:25    In practice if you were to prescribe bran for your younger patients and yeah. And, and what have you done previously to move treatment forward when things haven't gone to plan? Um, I could also ask how important is the impact on a, on a patient's mental health and self-esteem for your patients. Um, and also, uh, what, Speaker 1    00:06:49    What else Speaker 0    00:06:49    Is important to him when choosing a treatment for these patients? Yeah, I I'm aim to Speaker 1    00:06:58    I'm aim here Speaker 0    00:06:59    To get Dr. To reflect on, on a time in the past, when he has changed the newer treatments and, and share the impact, um, this had on his patients, I hope that Speaker 1    00:07:11    This will help him Speaker 0    00:07:12    See helping to see that based on the, the data, a change would be a good choice for his younger patients. I'll be looking, uh, closely at his body language here to ascertain how he's really feeling. What is his reaction when he reflects on making treatment changes in the past? I mean, how has he had a, a positive reaction? I will, um, I'll look to set up the data I'm about to present, uh, but outlining the fact that there is some data that I think he needs to see briefly to help them make a fair and accurate decision for these patients, I guess. Um, I guess the impact study by plaque etal is, is likely to be the one most aligned to the anticipated response. Dr. Sh you know, Dr. Shine to demonstrate the benefits on the dermatology of lifes, um, published in the general of, of, uh, clinical dermatology in, in 2016, they asked, uh, 1400 patients about the impact that psoriasis had on the quality of life. Speaker 0    00:08:17    And this is what they found. Um, in addition, in the 18 to 25 year old cohort, the percentage of people that, uh, said they had low self-esteem rose from 50% to 75%. And, and the percentage he said that they had really felt confident rose from 41% to 82%, um, also plan to use the wow, uh, trial to, um, demonstrate the legs, the number of patients trial on, um, versus ICEP and the impact of the PASI scores. Um, it would be important to highlight the authority of these studies, particularly the wow study published in the Lance with a large study cohort. And the aim is to give him the confidence that the studies are robust and therefore bra will be a good choice for his younger patients. Um, I will, uh, intend to ask him what he thinks about the data. Uh, I also plan to ask him if the data is reflective of his experience, I would like to challenge him if appropriate on what this data could mean for his patients. Speaker 0    00:09:36    In closing, I will, uh, summarize, uh, our discussion and the data I've taken through during the engagement and check if there's any further information he requires the initial, the, the initial high return productive question I will use is, um, so what needs to happen for you to be able to prescribe, to try and get him to volunteer his commitment? I will explore the next steps he's going to take following our discussion. I will also, uh, confirm my actions and time scales. Um, finally, I will then talk Dr. Off the platform and ask him for in engaging remotely, what worked well for him, uh, and anything we can do differently next time. I'll also, uh, send a prompt, approved email and look to schedule our next call. You'd Speaker 2    00:10:37    Hi. Good to you again. Uh, I think you may be mute. I, I can see you, but I can't, I can't hear you. It, um, if you look to the bottom of your screen, you'll see a microphone symbol click on this, uh, the sound should come through. Speaker 3    00:11:00    Okay. Yeah. Is, is that, is that better? Speaker 2    00:11:03    Yes. Yes. I can see, I'm hear you clearly now. Can I just double check that you can see me OK, too. Speaker 3    00:11:09    Yeah, yeah, yeah. Louis having to see and hear you perfectly just I'm, I'm a little new to this, so you're gonna have to, uh, uh, bear with me. Speaker 2    00:11:16    <laugh> yeah, no problem. It has a bit been a bit of a steep learning curve with this, um, this new way of working. Uh, but we are, we are using a really stable platform today. If for any reason we were into technical difficulties. Um, I could talk you through some steps to resolve them if we lose connection. Um, you'll just need to click the link in my email again, Joan, or you have my mobile number on there also. Speaker 3    00:11:41    Okay. We do. Thanks, Louis. Speaker 2    00:11:43    Yeah. So how are you last time? Uh, met you were, you were just heading off to see daughter in her, Speaker 3    00:11:53    Of course. Well, she was the, uh, the most delightful sheep I've ever seen <laugh> oh, Speaker 2    00:11:58    Oh, how cute. Speaker 3    00:12:00    Yeah, indeed. Although, although she was quite upset that she, uh, that she wasn't the donkey, <laugh> a strange child. Speaker 2    00:12:08    Well, there's always next year. Speaker 3    00:12:10    There certainly is. Speaker 2    00:12:12    Uh, and how have you been faring in this current, uh, very strange situation? Speaker 3    00:12:17    Um, no, not too bad. Thank you. We've been juggling the, uh, working and, and homeschooling, which has been interesting. Speaker 2    00:12:26    Ah, yes. Yeah. The homeschooling I too, I'm feeling that pain. How are you finding it? Speaker 3    00:12:32    Well, Whil, it's lovely to spend time with the children. Uh, I realized that I'm no teacher Speaker 2    00:12:38    <laugh> yeah, yes. Me too. I feel exactly the same. I think, uh, we all have learned some new skills over the last few months. Yeah, Speaker 3    00:12:46    Yeah, indeed. Speaker 2    00:12:47    Uh, and the impact on, uh, trust and patience. Speaker 3    00:12:52    Um, well we're about, I start seeing our patients in virtual clinics, which, which would be good. Speaker 2    00:12:57    It'd be great for them to I'm sure. Yeah. To contact with you. Speaker 3    00:13:02    Yeah. Well, the feedback so far has been really good, so we're pleased to try and get back to, to some kind of normal. Speaker 2    00:13:07    Yeah. Yeah. I totally understand that. Um, so the last time we met, uh, we spoke about rev and you were keen to learn more about it. Um, you were gonna sign up to the webcast about the mode of action with Dr. Mystery. Uh, how did, how did that go? Speaker 3    00:13:23    Yeah, that, that was a, a good meeting and I appreciated the opportunity to attend the online at home as it would've been what it would've been difficult to get to a live meeting. Speaker 2    00:13:32    Great. Yeah. I'll, I'll feed that back to the office as they like to know that these things are working. Um, so did the webcast change how you had been thinking about bra dermatol? Speaker 3    00:13:43    Uh, yes. And yes and no. Uh, I can certainly see the benefits, but, uh, just like all these new drugs, you just can't be sure of the long term safety. And, and that for me is, uh, a big hurdle to overcome. Speaker 2    00:13:56    Yeah. Yeah. I do understand another doctors who new tore originally have said the same, um, bra is new and as a result, there's less long term safety data than other drugs. However, as with all new drugs, we have lots of new data being published all the time. Um, and I'm keen, uh, today to take you through some of our large studies, which look at safety. Speaker 3    00:14:20    OK. Go on. Speaker 2    00:14:21    Um, in all the previous conversations that we've had, you've, you've made it to me that priority is the patient and that you, that you treat that patient as an individual and do for them. Speaker 3    00:14:34    Yeah, of course. Speaker 2    00:14:36    Key thing we've discussed is the patient's emotional, mental, and social wellbeing and the impact that psoriasis has on their quality of life. Um, I, I am aware that the CCG are heavily focused on reducing the number of patients with, uh, depression, um, and anxiety currently, as they recognize the impact. This has on an individual in leading a fulfilling life. Um, looking at the data, I can see that there is a higher population of younger people here than, than other areas of the potentially patients who are perhaps healthier with less comorbidities where severe psoriasis is having a real impact on their self-esteem and potentially their performance. Would you agree? Speaker 3    00:15:24    Yeah. Yeah. Speaker 2    00:15:25    Uh, based on this, uh, I would really like to focus on this patient group today, specifically one or two of your patients who are currently failing on a topical treatment, um, someone who needs to now move to an IV option to achieve better control of their condition and where rather could be, um, could, could be a good choice for them based on its efficacy and the resulting impact on their quality of life. Speaker 3    00:15:53    Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that, that, that's fine with me. I see a lot of younger people. Speaker 2    00:15:57    Okay. Yeah. Great. So if I can demonstrate the benefits of bra in this patient cohort, would you be willing to try it in order to gain your own experience? Speaker 3    00:16:07    Uh, yes. Yes. It would have to be a, a very good argument. Speaker 2    00:16:12    It, it will be good for you to try it yourself so you can see the benefits for your patients. Um, before we go any further, is there anything on your agenda that you wish to discuss with me today? Speaker 3    00:16:23    Uh, well, I, I would be interested to see any new data that you have. Speaker 2    00:16:29    Um, no problem. Um, so, uh, it's important. I have a clear picture of what you are looking for in a treatment for these patients. Uh, we have discussed, uh, that the impact on a patient's mental wellbeing is a key focus for you. What else is important to you when choosing a treatment for these patients? Speaker 3    00:16:49    Well, something that works well and, and works quickly with, with, with minimal side effects. Speaker 2    00:16:56    Tell, tell me more. Speaker 3    00:16:58    Well it's really, I patients, we get it first time, uh, worsen of it's important. We minimize the impacts of this as, as, as quickly as we can. Speaker 2    00:17:20    Yeah. I completely understand that. Is there anything else you wish for us to discuss today? Speaker 3    00:17:26    No, no, no. I think we're good. Speaker 2    00:17:28    Okay. Okay. Great. Let me start by showing you, um, yeah. Start by, uh, you through the, for the dermatology life quality index DL, QI uming with the gold. Okay. Can I, can I check? You can see my slides. Okay. Speaker 3    00:17:54    Uh, yeah. Yeah, there is. I can, I can see them. Speaker 2    00:17:57    Great. Great. If I can draw your attention to the graph on the right hand side here, I'm showing you, yeah. I'm show the impact study by, at, uh, published in the journal of clinical dermatology in 2016, um, asked 1400 patients about the impact that psoriasis had on their quality of life. And this is what they found now on top of these statistics in the 18 to 25 year old cohort, the percentage of people that said they had low self-esteem rose from 50% to seven. And the percentage you said that they rarely felt confident rose from 41% to 82%. Speaker 3    00:18:41    Wow. That's a, that's a big increase. Speaker 2    00:18:44    Yes, it is. Yeah. Now it's one thing me sitting here showing you statistics, but I'm keen to hear about what you see in your practice. Speaker 3    00:18:53    Uh, well, um, I, I see youngsters that, uh, don't go in and socialize or integrate with their peers because they, they don't feel compet in, in the way that they look, uh, quite often, it's the, uh, it's the first time that they're away from home, uh, from their families, they feel isolated and, and lonely. Uh, and then that then leads them to suffer from anxiety and depression. Speaker 2    00:19:24    And what impact does that have on their very reason for being away from home? Um, their study, uh, Speaker 3    00:19:33    Well, the they'll find it hard to sleep, uh, and to concentrate being, um, unhappy is, is an emotional drain. Quite often, they end up moving back home, which, yeah. Which is a shame Speaker 2    00:19:49    Must be so challenging for these patients, uh, in your experience, what happens next for them? Speaker 3    00:19:55    Well, I imagine that some of them never go on to find full-time employment and they end up feeling very isolated. Speaker 2    00:20:03    So for this patient group, when they come into your clinic, what is the ideal outcome for them? Speaker 3    00:20:10    The ideal outcome would be to reduce the amount of their body by psoriasis and also to review, reduce the severity of the lesion. So the patient feels more comfortable. Speaker 2    00:20:22    And when they walk outta your door, how do you measure your success? Speaker 3    00:20:27    Oh, partly for me, it's more about their quality of life. Uh, are they able to go out and integrate and live a happy fulfill life? Like they should. I mean, that mean that's why, that's why I do what I do. Speaker 2    00:20:39    Yeah. So if we could achieve say closer to PAI, 90 and significantly improve quality of life for, for this group, then would you feel that it would be a success? Speaker 3    00:20:51    Yes, it would. But all the drugs, uh, that do this are so expensive, which is why the hospital guideline suggests systemic second line to topical. Speaker 2    00:21:06    Sorry. Apologies. The, uh, the wifi seem to, um, seem to drop out there. Can you, can you hear and see me? OK. Speaker 3    00:21:15    Yeah. Louis, I, I have you back now. Speaker 2    00:21:18    Great. Hopefully won't have more issues if we do, if we do just stay on the platform, um, the wifi should, should catch up. Um, sorry. Back back to your point. Yeah. Um, I understand, uh, that cost has got to be part of the decision. Has there been a time in the past where you have prescribed a medicine off formulary? Speaker 3    00:21:41    Uh, yes. Yes. I have. I have had to do that in the past. Yeah. Speaker 2    00:21:45    Was there a particular reason for prescribing off formulary? Speaker 3    00:21:48    It came down individual what they needed at the time, uh, to give them the best chance of success. Speaker 2    00:21:54    So if we were to narrow this younger patient group down to an Indi, an individual, do you have anyone in mind who fits the criteria right now? Uh, someone who you are looking to move to the next step, who's suffering with their mental health and self-esteem due to that can do like, like the, like the students you mentioned earlier. Speaker 3    00:22:13    Yeah. Yeah. I, I have one person in mind. Speaker 2    00:22:17    Can we concentrate on that one person then? Speaker 3    00:22:20    Okay, well let's, let's see what you have to say. Speaker 2    00:22:24    You've mentioned systemic drugs. Am I right to saying that the preferred one is yes. In the past when you changed from using NORRA toe? Yeah. What prompted you to make that decision? Speaker 3    00:22:37    Uh, well, that's a good question. Uh, well, it was based on the, and Speaker 2    00:22:44    If you could further improve, what would you change? Speaker 3    00:22:49    Well, I I'd certainly improve the PASI score. It's good. But on average, we see PASI 75 at very, for this patient. I don't think there would be enough to improve. Self-esteem I'd also improve the side effects, Associa with it, see a nausea, dizziness. Speaker 2    00:23:08    Okay. Um, those side effects have on, on the patients. Speaker 3    00:23:14    Well, sometimes they end up canceling the appointments for their injection and then they don't reschedule until their psoriasis is so bad that they don't have another option or sometimes occasionally they're they're so ill. Speaker 2    00:23:29    So what would you from for me to convince you that bra is right for this patient that you have in mind? Speaker 3    00:23:38    Well, I would need to see that the results for this patient in terms of PAI score and quality of, of life outweigh my concerns about the risk of taking a new drug. Speaker 2    00:23:48    Right. Well, can I show you the data we have so far? OK. Can you see, can you see my screen? OK. Um, this slide is titled the wow trial. Speaker 3    00:24:01    Yeah. Yeah. I can see it. Speaker 2    00:24:02    Great. Um, there is quite a bit of info on here. So I'm going to draw your attention firstly, to the study design, as you can see, this study was published in the Lance in 2017, it was a randomized, uh, multicenter head to head trial, comparing bra against and intercept, uh, total number of patients 3000 and the trial for three years. Well Speaker 3    00:24:27    That that's, that's a big trial for, for a lot longer than I expected. Speaker 2    00:24:30    Yeah. And if I now draw your attention to the graph, uh, you can clearly see the study compared with the most commonly used. Can you see, uh, the graph? Speaker 2    00:24:44    Um, you can see the next to the right of the graph that, um, patients in the trial had severe psoriasis defined as a Pazi level, more than 15. And patients had all been on topical treatment and were at the point of needing the next step up. Um, they were then randomized to receive one of the three treatment arms shows the primary endpoint, uh, was the improvement in PA scores and the results were as follows. So the, the percentage of patients who achieve PASI 90 has a 90% improvement in PAI, uh, score on 50% mm-hmm <affirmative> on incept 75 and on bra 90%, furthermore, 89 of pat, 89% of patients on bra achieved PAI 90 for the four, three years remaining on bra. Whereas the me percentage that remained on intercept was 57% and for eight 54%. So this means that the patient we're focusing on is highly likely to achieve PA 90 for a four, three years on bra. Um, how, how would that impact her life do you think? Speaker 3    00:26:03    Uh, I mean that would have a hugely positive, uh, impact on, on her confidence and, and self esteem. Speaker 2    00:26:13    And what would that allow her to do that? She currently can't Speaker 3    00:26:16    Well, she'd be able to integrate with her peers. Uh, she's about noting, but this, this, this thence to just be herself again. Speaker 2    00:26:27    Yeah. What would for you? Speaker 3    00:26:29    Oh, my aim is, is to get these patients as well as possible as quickly as possible. I'd please. Speaker 2    00:26:36    So the results look good. So, um, let's can you see the scores here? Speaker 3    00:26:47    Uh, yep. Yeah. I can see them. Speaker 2    00:26:50    Um, a secondary measure in the trial was a reduction in the DQ I score from baseline. And as you can see from the graph here, patients Onder scored a better quality of life than for of the, the other treatments and at each year. And now for the other treatments, you can see here that the quality of life school started to drop in response to the treatment efficacy, starting to drop. Whereas bra continue to be better than baseline. This means that your patient will continue to feel happier and, and more confident and will hope on to fulfill her. So, uh, what you thinking now? Speaker 3    00:27:31    Well, I'm thinking is you've Speaker 2    00:27:43    To just change the slides, if you, yeah. If you look to the box and the center of the slide, you can see yeah. The re the number of adverse events that were recorded. Yeah. Are you with me? Speaker 3    00:27:59    Yeah. Yeah. And we're Speaker 2    00:28:01    Great. So here, you can see that the adverse events were significantly lower for Brava, then the other treatment arms, uh, and, and 90% of the adverse events were related to the infusion. All of which were mild by nature and can be managed using premed premeds. Um, so, so what do you think of the wow trial data overall? Speaker 3    00:28:23    It looks really good. Um, I'm impressed by the number of patients and the, the length of the trial. Speaker 2    00:28:29    Has this demonstrated that for the patient we have discussed, uh, bra would be an effective choice. Speaker 3    00:28:35    Yes. I think for this patient, I, I feel comfortable just follow my decision. Speaker 2    00:28:39    Yeah. Great. Well, um, I I'll email this over to you now. Uh, so you have a copy your information or to use in case you need to discuss decision with the pharmacy. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Speaker 3    00:28:58    OK. Yeah. No, I think, I think that's it. Yeah. Speaker 2    00:29:00    Yeah. If you, if you open it up. Okay. Yeah. I'll just show you what else it can do. Speaker 3    00:29:06    Yeah. Speaker 2    00:29:08    Yeah. If you click on, um, click on the graph, there will take you through to med tech connect. And on there, you can find a lot more information. Speaker 3    00:29:18    Oh, <laugh> I didn't realize you could do that. Speaker 2    00:29:21    Yeah. It's a really great tool. Yeah. OK. Um, so we have looked at the, uh, quality of life and impact that bra has on these scores in the upper patient group. Um, we have also looked at the efficacy and effect on the PAI scores. You're also interested in the adverse event data, which we've also discussed. Um, what else needs to happen for you to be able to use bra? Speaker 3    00:29:48    Well, I I'm thinking for, for the patient, we identified bras a good option. Um, I suppose I have one nagging thought and that the, the capacity to deliver the infusion, we just seem to be getting busy home busier. So, Speaker 2    00:30:03    Yeah. I do understand other doctors have expressed this too. Um, when you say capacity, uh, what is it that you mean? I, is it the, the space or the manpower? Speaker 3    00:30:13    Uh, it's the manpower, to be honest, we only have two nurses and they seem to be stacked out all the time. Speaker 2    00:30:19    Yeah. I did have a brief chat with Catherine week and she said she had an idea for the best way to accommodate rather than patients. Um, she did say that she'll be available today to join us and discuss it with us. Speaker 3    00:30:31    Ah, yeah. She's, she's off sick today, unfortunately. Speaker 2    00:30:34    Ah, oh no. Okay. What shame? Um, I do hope she is. Yeah, but soon. Um, do you know when she'll be back, uh, at work? I mean, it would be good for us to meet with Catherine to discuss her idea. Speaker 3    00:30:46    Yeah, I agree. Uh, I mean, she's the one that's managing the infusions, so if she thinks it can be done, then I'm happy. Um, yes. I mean, she should, she should be back in the next week or so. Speaker 2    00:30:58    Okay. Well, why don't we set up another call for next week and Catherine can join us if she's back. Um, if not, we can discuss alternative ways in which we could ensure this patient is able to receive bra. Speaker 3    00:31:10    OK. Let's give it a go. Um, yeah. Will you send a, send me a link to the meeting like today's meeting? Speaker 2    00:31:17    Yes, of course I can do it now. Uh, what would be the best time and date for you? Speaker 3    00:31:21    Um, yeah, well, uh, uh, yeah, probably same time again, actually Wednesday, 1230. Speaker 2    00:31:30    Okay. Yeah. So what will happen after our meeting today? I will send you an email, uh, that will confirm the date and time, and it will also contain a link that will allow you to attend the meeting online. Okay. On the day, the call, you just need to click the link like you did today and we good to go. Um, I'll also catch up with, uh, before the call to ensure she's comfortable with, with the technology. Speaker 3    00:31:54    Great, great. That's fine. I forward the email to Catherine when she send it. Speaker 2    00:31:59    So if we sort the capacity, is there anything else that happen in order to be ready for this patient to receive, receive bra? Speaker 3    00:32:08    Uh, well, as it's not in the form yet, uh, so I need to submit forms for urgent or compassionate use. Uh, yeah. I mean, what about the, uh, what about the pharmacy? Will they know about it and will they have stock? Speaker 2    00:32:22    Yes. Uh, I've spoken to pharmacy and they do have stock. Uh, the, the hospital currently has eight patients receiving bra. Speaker 3    00:32:29    Yeah. Um, who's been, who's been doing that then. Speaker 2    00:32:32    Oh, Dr. Kline, uh, has been trialing bra with great success. Speaker 3    00:32:36    Oh, yes. Uh, well that wouldn't surprise me. <laugh> no, I'll, I'll go and have a, a quick chat with him about it. He can help me fill out the forms and we definitely need to sort out the capacity issue if we're gonna be seeing a lot of new patients initiated on it. Speaker 2    00:32:50    Yeah. Good idea. Yeah. I know his team to get on, get it on formula as he's seeing some great results. Uh, he would be able to share as a experience with you ready for when your patient is next in clinic. Speaker 3    00:33:02    Well, the, the patient's due to come back to clinic in a, in a couple of weeks, actually. So I aim to discuss with her then to explain about a drug and administration. And if she's to switch and we've sorted out the, then we'll book a that's convenient for Speaker 2    00:33:17    That's great news. Um, I've ordered some more PO patient information leaflets, get them sent directly to you. Um, I will follow up with you as soon as they have been sent. Speaker 3    00:33:27    Okay. That's fine. Speaker 2    00:33:29    Okay. I'm gonna make a note of that in my diary. Um, well, it's been great to see you again, and I look forward to seeing how this patient benefits from bra. Um, <affirmative> I look forward to seeing you on our link call next week. Speaker 3    00:33:43    Oh, well, good to see you too. Uh, again, Louis Speaker 2    00:33:46    And, and you, um, I will close this meeting from my end. Uh, you just need to close your browser, um, and I'll see you next Wednesday. Okay. Bye Speaker 3    00:33:56    Bye. Speaker 0    00:34:07    Good engagement with Dr. Shine through the virtual platform. He gave good feedback that it worked well for him. Um, the objective, uh, to discuss the impact of severe psoriasis on the quality of life in the younger patient group and gave a in trialing patient presented the study, uh, specifically focusing on the 1825 cohort, uh, Dr. Agreed that the impact on the quality of life can be very severe for his patients and impact their daily lives. Um, we discussed the wow study, uh, and the impact that a higher PAI school will have on, on a patient quality of life. Uh, Dr. Che identified a patient in which he would like to trial bra. Uh, we discussed the data on adverse events and he was happy with the results. One area he did have a concern with was a capacity to trial in clinic. The, the team are extremely busy. Uh, I discussed that Catherine, the league nurse has some ideas on how to manage this. We have booked a further meeting, both Dr. Shine and Catherine, um, next week to discuss this, Uh, Catherine is currently off six. So I'll need to check if she's back prior to our next meeting, I've agreed with Dr. Shine that if she isn't back, we will explore other ways in which the department can manage this, uh, this one patient to, I also shared, uh, the me tech connect email. This was really effective. Dr. Shine commented on it being useful. Uh, Dr. Shine has agreed to touch base with Dr. Klein to gain feedback on his experience using bra. I will email Dr. Klein to arrange for a, to.
