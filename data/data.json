(WAVES BACK) MSLCan I just check who else we have in the meeting please? DRYes, of course, does everyone want to introduce   themselves? JDrHi, I’m Julie one of the junior doctors working alongside Dr Lewis at the moment. MSLGreat to meet you Julie, can I ask what stage you’re at in your training? JDrSure, I’m an F2 so still pretty early on. MSLWell it’s great to meet you, thanks for joining the meeting. NSHi, I’m Sally the Lung Specialist Nurse. MSLBrilliant, lovely to meet you Sally. Thanks for introducing yourselves, are we expecting anyone else? DRI don’t think so. MSLGreat, thank you. Let me introduce myself, I’m Laurence from Pharmapro and  I am here in response to a medical request you made through my colleague Louise.  I would like to take you through the data regarding Avant which is licensed in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced or locally advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer that have progressed following first line treatment with platinum chemotherapy. Is that what you were expecting this meeting to be about? DRYes, that’s what I was hoping for! MSLExcellent, my aim is that by the end of the presentation I will have provided you with the information you need to support your treatment decisions for your patients. I am keen to answer any questions you may have so do please ask questions as we go through the data. DrGreat, thanks MSLDid any of you get the opportunity to attend the virtual ASCO meeting last month? DrYes, I did, it was a really great meeting MSLFantastic, I got to attend several of the sessions myself and was really impressed with the data and advancements in patient care that I saw. DrYes, I really enjoy ASCO as there is always so much great content. MSLWhat presentation stood out for you? DrSo many of them to be honest but the ones I found most interesting were the ones with the new biomarkers, it’s incredible how much we are discovering now in terms of targets for treatment and indicators for disease. MSLI know, it’s incredible and so promising for patients and clinicians alike.  Did you attend any of the presentations about Avant or ELC testing? DrYes, you couldn’t really miss it, there seemed to be a lot of studies being presented on both the drug and the testing. MSLYeah, there’s a significant level of interest in exploring what both the treatment and the test can offer lung cancer patients who have advanced disease, as you know, these patients can be very challenging to manage.  Can I ask what you remember from the presentations you observed? DrOf course, I know that your phase 3 study showed an improvement in progression free survival as well as overall survival and I understand that the particular protein the drug targets … sorry I can’t remember the name of the protein, but the protein is present in over 50% of patients – is that correct? MSLFantastic, it sounds like you have a good handle on the key elements, can I just ask your colleagues how much they know about Avant?  Julie?  Sally? JDrI have to admit I know very little about this treatment, so I am looking forward to learning from you. NSI have heard bits and bobs and I know as a team we are looking to start testing so it would be helpful to know a bit more. MSLOk, great, well if this works for you, I propose that I take you through the data and the testing set up and then we can leave some time for any questions you may have, should take about 15 minutes, does that sound ok? DrPerfect, thank you. MSLCan I ask what discussions you have had to date with the other consultants about it? DrWell after ASCO, I brought it up at a recent MDT meeting we had. MSLWas that in relation to a specific patient you were discussing? DrNo, not really MSLOk, just a general conversation about treatment options? Dr (NODS) Yeah, pretty much. MSLIn terms of the testing element, what information are you looking for specifically? Dr(SCRATCHES HEAD/THINKS) Best method of testing for the protein and the sensitivity of the test are both important to know. ******************************** MSL(NODS) Ok, I have a few slides on that here. As you may be aware, it’s a simple immunohistochemistry test you just need access to the antibody. Dr(SITS FORWARD) Where do we get the antibody from? MSLYou can order it direct from the company. DrDo we need a special testing kit? MSLYou can purchase an ELC ready-to-use assay, I have a leaflet I can leave on that showing the details. Dr Will the pathologists understand all of this? MSLYes, they should be very familiar with these types of tests. Dr Ok, so what are the tissue requirements to be able to perform the test? MSLThat’s a good question.  As you know tissue is difficult to get in lung cancer cases and the requirements in terms of size of sample is not that high, it is more important that the sample contains as many cancer cells as possible. DrSo any sample is better than nothing in terms of size? MSLI think in the discovery phase, as you build your experience, it would make sense to test as many samples as possible.  It might be worth speaking to your pathologists to check, but I would imagine their expectations in terms of tissue sample would be similar across the board. DrWell I suppose so, I guess we always try to get a good sample. MSLIn terms of the cut offs, they looked at whether a sample contained 25, 50 or 75% positive tumour cells and it was deemed that the ELC expression was high if the sample contained greater than 50% of cells expressing the protein.  Which means that if 50% or more of the cancer cells in the sample expresses the protein then the drug should work. DrDoes that mean, we would only use Avant in those patients who have 50% or greater expression? MSLYes, that’s correct. DrWhat percentage of patients would you expect to have 50% ELC expression in their tumours? MSLThe current data, which I am showing on the screen, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Professor Sykes in 2018, suggests up to 65% of advanced or locally advanced non-small cell tumours may have some expression of ELC, the level of expression within the individuals is not yet known which is why everyone who could be eligible for treatment should be tested. DrOk, I see.  Do you need to re-biopsy when they progress? MSLThe data supports use of either material from the initial biopsy or from a second biopsy following progression, as it’s difficult to get tissue for the initial diagnosis, I imagine it must be even harder the second time round.  Do you re-biopsy many patients at progression? Dr We do if we can, just in case the cancer has mutated, but it’s not always possible. MSLYes, we hear from a lot of clinicians that getting access to good tissue samples is particularly challenging. Dr It can be, we do a lot of EBUS at this hospital, are cytology samples ok to use? MSL If they can be formalin fixed into a block and sliced then yes DrOk, I think that’s what they do with them, maybe another one for me to check with the pathologists. (MAKES A NOTE) MSLIf you would like me to support with any of the information you want to discuss with the pathologists then please let me know. DrYes, I might need some support, will see how I get on first. MSLOk, so that’s it in terms of the test, is there any other information you would like to know on that matter? DrI don’t think so, sounds like I need to speak to the pathologists first. MSLNo problem, and as I said I can support with any information if you need me to. NSWe have a meeting with Dr Williamson (the pathologist) at the end of the week, would you like me to add it to the agenda? DrYes please Sally, that would be great. DrAre you able to send me those slides you have? MSLThese ones on the detail around the testing requirements? DrYes, then I could forward them on to Dr Williamson MSLYes, that’s no problem at all, I can do that. DrThanks. MSLWhen you have introduced a new diagnostic test previously, what process did you follow to ensure it was integrated with minimal disruption to the turn around times of results? DrTo be honest, the pathologists do most of that, we just let them know which patients need testing when we have the MDT meeting. MSLOk, I see, whilst I understand that the pathologists take the lead on it, is there anything that you would improve about the process you currently have for identifying which patients require which diagnostic test? DrTo be honest, it works pretty well, I do think we should be quicker at adopting new tests though. MSLIs there anything specific you think that could be done? (LEANS FORWARD) DrProbably not, a lot of it comes down to funding within the trust and getting things through approval. MSLThat is similar in every trust to be honest. DrYes, I think it is a standard issue. (NODS IN AGREEMENT) MSLShall we have a look at the data now? Dr Yes please MSLIs there anything particular any of you would like me to focus on? DrAn overview of the phase 3 trial would be useful for me. NSI’d be keen to understand what side effects we are likely to see and how to manage them please. MSLOf course, we can certainly cover that. Can everyone see the title slide with the study name on it? Dr/JDr/NS Yes (all together) MSLThe phase 3 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, and multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of Avant in combination with Docetaxel as second line therapy in patients with advanced or locally advanced NSCLC following first line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary outcomes measured were progression free survival and overall survival and the secondary outcome measured was change in patient reported outcomes. Can you tell me what the title of the slide is that you can see on the screen? DrInclusion/Exclusion Criteria MSLGreat, well as you can see, these were in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as you can see patients in the study had all progressed after 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. There were 602 patients in the study randomised to one of two arms. Any patients who had received any other systemic treatment for their cancer other than the platinum-based chemo were excluded from the study. The results are now showing on the screen and were as follows: Objective response rate = 45% vs 21%, progression free survival = 6.3 months vs 2.1 months and overall survival of 12.1 months vs 9.6 months. You can see on the graph here, the separation of the curves and a hazard ratio of 0.7 In terms of the patient recorded outcomes when looking at cough, chest pain, fatigue, and loss of appetite.  Participants reported on average a 25% improvement in symptom scores across all measures. What stands out for you in that data? DrIt’s certainly encouraging outcomes NSI’m pleased to see the improvement in symptom scores, for these patients, quality of life is so important. MSLAbsolutely, it’s important that we look at the impact on patients’ lives as well as the efficacy of the treatment. DrCould you just remind of the dosing again? MSLCertainly, let me just pull the dosing slide up for you, can you see that?  The dose, is weight dependent and is an infusion, but the treatment schedule is as follows: Avant + Docetaxel every 3 weeks or Placebo + Docetaxel every 3 weeks Dr So you say its weight based, what’s the calculation? MSLIts 0.2mg/kg DrAnd how often is that given? MSLIt’s given on Day 1 of each 3-weekly cycle alongside Docetaxel. DrSally, can you make a note of that for the nurses on the chemo suite? NSYes, no problem at all. Do you have the Adverse Events information you can show? MSLYes, of course, let me just pull the slide up…. Can you see the slide entitled Treatment Emergent Adverse Events? NSYes, we can see that. MSLPerfect, antibody drug conjugates tend to be well tolerated because they deliver the cytotoxic payload into the tumour cell meaning that very little goes into the healthy tissue, however like any treatment there are side effects.  What this slide shows you is the incidence of each of the reported adverse events, is there anything particular that stands out for you? NSEmmmm….  It actually looks like it’s generally well tolerated…  I’m quite surprised.  Are there any particular things we need to consider to mitigate the risks? MSLNot particularly, just the usual supportive treatments you would use for patients with this stage cancer. NSOk, great, thank you. MSLIs there anything else you would like me to show you in terms of the data? DrNo, I think we have enough there to be going on with. MSLGreat, so in terms of next steps, how do you plan to take this forward as a team? DrI think we will discuss it again at the MDT, I also need to catch up with Dr Williamson to discuss the pathology set up. MSLWhat additional information or support do you need from me? DrI think it would be good if you could send me the slides you have shown us today so I can reference them when discussing with ym colleagues. MSLOf course, would you be interested in signing up to our Clinical Paper Portal which would give you access to all the clinical studies for Avant? DrThat sounds helpful, what would I need to do? MSLIf you’re happy for me to pass your email address on to my colleague in our Medical Information department they will create you an account and send you the link. DrYes, that would be great, thank you. MSLI also note from the registrations that you have signed up to our upcoming webinar “The Evolution of Treatments for Advanced Lung Cancer”.  Sally, Julie – would you like me to send you the information on the webinar? JDrYes please, that would be interesting. NSSure, I’ll take a look. MSLDr Lewis – the webinar will focus on some case studies that are developing, is this something you might be interested in being involved in? DrI might be, I’d need to know a bit more. MSLWould it be ok to reach out to you after the webinar to discuss in more depth? DrYes, that would be fine. MSLOk, well I’m conscious of time, I will send out the webinar information and get Dr Lewis set up on the clinical paper portal.  I know you have plans to speak to your pathologist and the wider team, please do let me know if you need any support with that. DrWill do, many thanks MSLYour welcome, look forward to speaking with you all again. ALLBye, thanks, bye etc…", "segments": "[\"MSLHello Dr Lewis, can you see me, ok? (WAVES) DrHello, yes I can.

Nice to see you again. HCP:Hi. RE:How are you? HCP:Yes, really good, thanks, Rachael. How are you? Nice to see you. RE:I’m very well, thank you. Thank you for meeting with me today. RE:Remind me, Tracey, I understand from Partridge Health that you’re looking to repatriate your CCPs, so I was hoping today if we could just chat about that a little bit and just ask you a few questions about that, if that’d be okay? HCP:Yes, of course. Yes. RE:Great. So before I go into that, I just wanted to do a little bit more of a background to the lab. So with your instrument set-up at the moment, what instruments do you have in immunology at the moment? HCP:In immunology, obviously we’ve got the Optimed 360, just the one of those. RE:So with the CCPs, Tracey, what’s your workload at the moment? How many are you doing a day, roughly? HCP:A day? Gosh, I think current workload is about 250 a month that we’re sending away. RE:And so you’re sending them away to Partridge at the moment, and what analyser do they run them on? HCP:They’re using the Biovance automated system, so they just pop them on and they’re tracked and the turnaround times are really rapid, which is fantastic. RE:So in terms of bringing them back in house then, in a perfect world, how would you like to see the service set-up for  your CCPs here? How would you like to run them, do you think? HCP:I think the main plan is, because we also have automation downstairs, there is the Biovance tracking system, and therefore it’s a good crossover, it minimises the comparison we need to do as we’re using that test already, we’re kind of used to the results, and, in-house, all we have to do is a minor validation of the methods to see that we’re producing similar results. RE:I see, so turnaround times are key really for you? HCP:Yes, seven days for CCPs. RE:Seven days, currently, okay. So with the Optimed 360 at the moment, are you running that every day? HCP:Yes, most days. RE:And how often do you run the EliA IgG method? HCP:That’s pretty much every day, for a variety of tests. RE:So what would you say, then, if we could look at, say, for example, running your CCPs three times a day? Because am I right in thinking that CCP testing, it’s not classed as urgent, per se? HCP:No, that’s why it’s got quite a generous turnaround time compared to MPA, PR3s and things like that. RE:With it being continuous loading, we could have the EliA IgG method set up every day, and maybe you could prioritise three days but know that you’ve got the leeway, and then you can feed the samples through every day, and you would still be comfortably within your seven-day turnaround. HCP:Sure. One thing though, what’s the first time to result for those? RE:I want to say it’s about an hour and a half, but I’m not entirely sure. Funny you say that, actually, I’ve got a brochure that talks about the process time and shows a schematic, but I don’t actually have any with me, so sorry about that, but I could maybe get one to you. But that shows quite nicely the time to first result. So still comfortably within your working day, and working during the three days per week for CCPs, you would be within your turnaround time. HCP:Okay, yes. If you could forward that on, that’d be really handy, please. RE:Yes. So does that sounds like something that would work in terms of doing CCP three times a day, do you think that would fit? HCP:Yes, I think, at this stage, depending on costs, etc., it’s worth thinking about, definitely. RE:And then, what would be involved in that, Tracey, in terms of if you wanted to consider looking at them on the Optimed 360? HCP:Well, obviously you know we’ve never got enough staff and there’s never enough time, is there any way you could give us some support with an evaluation? Because if we were going to do a Biovance evaluation, it would be minimal, whereas if we were considering the 360, it would be a substantially larger study. So… RE:Yes, I’m sure we could sort something out for you, that’s no problem. Leave that with me. HCP:Okay, thank you. RE:So that’s really great. I’ve got a good understanding of what you’re looking to achieve. So perhaps maybe the next step would be we could arrange another meeting and we can talk about it again in a little bit more detail.

HCP:Yes, really good, thanks, Rachael. How are you? Nice to see you. RE:I\\u2019m very well, thank you. Thank you for meeting with me today. RE:Remind me, Tracey, I understand from Partridge Health that you\\u2019re looking to repatriate your CCPs, so I was hoping today if we could just chat about that a little bit and just ask you a few questions about that, if that\\u2019d be okay? HCP:Yes, of course. Yes. RE:Great. So before I go into that, I just wanted to do a little bit more of a background to the lab. So with your instrument set-up at the moment, what instruments do you have in immunology at the moment? HCP:In immunology, obviously we\\u2019ve got the Optimed 360, just the one of those. RE:So with the CCPs, Tracey, what\\u2019s your workload at the moment? How many are you doing a day, roughly? HCP:A day? Gosh, I think current workload is about 250 a month that we\\u2019re sending away. RE:And so you\\u2019re sending them away to Partridge at the moment, and what analyser do they run them on? HCP:They\\u2019re using the Biovance automated system, so they just pop them on and they\\u2019re tracked and the turnaround times are really rapid, which is fantastic. RE:So in terms of bringing them back in house then, in a perfect world, how would you like to see the service set-up for your CCPs here? How would you like to run them, do you think? HCP:I think the main plan is, because we also have automation downstairs, there is the Biovance tracking system, and therefore it\\u2019s a good crossover, it minimises the comparison we need to do as we\\u2019re using that test already, we\\u2019re kind of used to the results, and, in-house, all we have to do is a minor validation of the methods to see that we\\u2019re producing similar results. RE:I see, so turnaround times are key really for you? HCP:Yes, seven days for CCPs. RE:Seven days, currently, okay. So with the Optimed 360 at the moment, are you running that every day? HCP:Yes, most days. RE:And how often do you run the EliA IgG method? HCP:That\\u2019s pretty much every day, for a variety of tests. RE:So what would you say, then, if we could look at, say, for example, running your CCPs three times a day? Because am I right in thinking that CCP testing, it\\u2019s not classed as urgent, per se? HCP:No, that\\u2019s why it\\u2019s got quite a generous turnaround time compared to MPA, PR3s and things like that. RE:With it being continuous loading, we could have the EliA IgG method set up every day, and maybe you could prioritise three days but know that you\\u2019ve got the leeway, and then you can feed the samples through every day, and you would still be comfortably within your seven-day turnaround. HCP:Sure. One thing though, what\\u2019s the first time to result for those? RE:I want to say it\\u2019s about an hour and a half, but I\\u2019m not entirely sure. Funny you say that, actually, I\\u2019ve got a brochure that talks about the process time and shows a schematic, but I don\\u2019t actually have any with me, so sorry about that, but I could maybe get one to you. But that shows quite nicely the time to first result. So still comfortably within your working day, and working during the three days per week for CCPs, you would be within your turnaround time.

MSL:Brilliant, lovely to meet you Sally. Thanks for introducing yourselves, are we expecting anyone else? DR:   I don’t think so. MSL:Great, thank you. Let me introduce myself, I’m Laurence from Pharmapro and  I am here in response to a medical request you made through my colleague Louise.  I would like to take you through the data regarding Avant which is licensed in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced or locally advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer that have progressed following first line treatment with platinum chemotherapy. Is that what you were expecting this meeting to be about? DR:   Yes, that’s what I was hoping for! MSL:Excellent, my aim is that by the end of the presentation I will have provided you with the information you need to support your treatment decisions for your patients. I am keen to answer any questions you may have so do please ask questions as we go through the data. Dr:    Great, thanks MSL:Did any of you get the opportunity to attend the virtual ASCO meeting last month? Dr:    Yes, I did, it was a really great meeting MSL:Fantastic, I got to attend several of the sessions myself and was really impressed with the data and advancements in patient care that I saw. Dr:    Yes, I really enjoy ASCO as there is always so much great content. MSL:What presentation stood out for you? Dr:    So many of them to be honest but the ones I found most interesting were the ones with the new biomarkers, it’s incredible how much we are discovering now in terms of targets for treatment and indicators for disease. MSL:I know, it’s incredible and so promising for patients and clinicians alike.  Did you attend any of the presentations about Avant or ELC testing? Dr:    Yes, you couldn’t really miss it, there seemed to be a lot of studies being presented on both the drug and the testing. MSL:Yeah, there’s a significant level of interest in exploring what both the treatment and the test can offer lung cancer patients who have advanced disease, as you know, these patients can be very challenging to manage.  Can I ask what you remember from the presentations you observed? Dr:    Of course, I know that your phase 3 study showed an improvement in progression free survival as well as overall survival and I understand that the particular protein the drug targets … sorry I can’t remember the name of the protein, but the protein is present in over 50% of patients – is that correct? MSL:Fantastic, it sounds like you have a good handle on the key elements, can I just ask your colleagues how much they know about Avant?  Julie?  Sally? JDr:  I have to admit I know very little about this treatment, so I am looking forward to learning from you. NS:   I have heard bits and bobs and I know as a team we are looking to start testing so it would be helpful to know a bit more. MSL:Ok, great, well if this works for you, I propose that I take you through the data and the testing set up and then we can leave some time for any questions you may have, should take about 15 minutes, does that sound ok? Dr:    Perfect, thank you. MSL:Can I ask what discussions you have had to date with the other consultants about it? Dr:    Well after ASCO, I brought it up at a recent MDT meeting we had. MSL:Was that in relation to a specific patient you were discussing? Dr:    No, not really MSL:Ok, just a general conversation about treatment options? Dr:    (NODS) Yeah, pretty much. MSL:In terms of the testing element, what information are you looking for specifically? Dr:    (SCRATCHES HEAD/THINKS) Best method of testing for the protein and the sensitivity of the test are both important to know. MSL:(NODS) Ok, I have a few slides on that here. ::  As you may be aware, it’s a simple immunohistochemistry test you just need access to the antibody. Dr:    (SITS FORWARD) Where do we get the antibody from? MSL:You can order it direct from the company. Dr:    Do we need a special testing kit? MSL:You can purchase an ELC ready-to-use assay, I have a leaflet I can leave on that showing the details. Dr:    Will the pathologists understand all of this? MSL:Yes, they should be very familiar with these types of tests. Dr:    Ok, so what are the tissue requirements to be able to perform the test? MSL:That’s a good question.  As you know tissue is difficult to get in lung cancer cases and the requirements in terms of size of sample is not that high, it is more important that the sample contains as many cancer cells as possible. Dr:    So any sample is better than nothing in terms of size? MSL:I think in the discovery phase, as you build your experience, it would make sense to test as many samples as possible.  It might be worth speaking to your pathologists to check, but I would imagine their expectations in terms of tissue sample would be similar across the board. Dr:    Well I suppose so, I guess we always try to get a good sample. MSL:In terms of the cut offs, they looked at whether a sample contained 25, 50 or 75% positive tumour cells and it was deemed that the ELC expression was high if the sample contained greater than 50% of cells expressing the protein.  Which means that if 50% or more of the cancer cells in the sample expresses the protein then the drug should work. Dr:    Does that mean, we would only use Avant in those patients who have 50% or greater expression? MSL:Yes, that’s correct. Dr:    What percentage of patients would you expect to have 50% ELC expression in their tumours? MSL:The current data, which I am showing on the screen, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Professor Sykes in 2018, suggests up to 65% of advanced or locally advanced non-small cell tumours may have some expression of ELC, the level of expression within the individuals is not yet known which is why everyone who could be eligible for treatment should be tested. Dr:    Ok, I see.  Do you need to re-biopsy when they progress? MSL:The data supports use of either material from the initial biopsy or from a second biopsy following progression, as it’s difficult to get tissue for the initial diagnosis, I imagine it must be even harder the second time round.  Do you re-biopsy many patients at progression? Dr:    We do if we can, just in case the cancer has mutated, but it’s not always possible. MSL:Yes, we hear from a lot of clinicians that getting access to good tissue samples is particularly challenging. Dr:    It can be, we do a lot of EBUS at this hospital, are cytology samples ok to use? MSL If they can be formalin fixed into a block and sliced then yes Dr:    Ok, I think that’s what they do with them, maybe another one for me to check with the pathologists. (MAKES A NOTE) MSL:If you would like me to support with any of the information you want to discuss with the pathologists then please let me know. Dr:    Yes, I might need some support, will see how I get on first. MSL:Ok, so that’s it in terms of the test, is there any other information you would like to know on that matter? Dr:    I don’t think so, sounds like I need to speak to the pathologists first. MSL:No problem, and as I said I can support with any information if you need me to. NS:   We have a meeting with Dr Williamson (the pathologist) at the end of the week, would you like me to add it to the agenda? Dr:    Yes please Sally, that would be great. Dr:    Are you able to send me those slides you have? MSL:These ones on the detail around the testing requirements? Dr:    Yes, then I could forward them on to Dr Williamson MSL:Yes, that’s no problem at all, I can do that. Dr:    Thanks. MSL:When you have introduced a new diagnostic test previously, what process did you follow to ensure it was integrated with minimal disruption to the turn around times of results? Dr:    To be honest, the pathologists do most of that, we just let them know which patients need testing when we have the MDT meeting. MSL:Ok, I see, whilst I understand that the pathologists take the lead on it, is there anything that you would improve about the process you currently have for identifying which patients require which diagnostic test? Dr:    To be honest, it works pretty well, I do think we should be quicker at adopting new tests though. MSL:Is there anything specific you think that could be done? (LEANS FORWARD) Dr:    Probably not, a lot of it comes down to funding within the trust and getting things through approval. MSL:That is similar in every trust to be honest. Dr:    Yes, I think it is a standard issue. (NODS IN AGREEMENT) MSL:Shall we have a look at the data now? Dr:    Yes please MSL:Is there anything particular any of you would like me to focus on? Dr:    An overview of the phase 3 trial would be useful for me. NS:   I’d be keen to understand what side effects we are likely to see and how to manage them please. MSL:Of course, we can certainly cover that. Can everyone see the title slide with the study name on it? Dr/JDr/NS Yes (all together) MSL:The phase 3 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, and multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of Avant in combination with Docetaxel as second line therapy in patients with advanced or locally advanced NSCLC following first line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary outcomes measured were progression free survival and overall survival and the secondary outcome measured was change in patient reported outcomes. Can you tell me what the title of the slide is that you can see on the screen? Dr:    Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria MSL:Great, well as you can see, these were in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as you can see patients in the study had all progressed after 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. There were 602 patients in the study randomised to one of two arms. Any patients who had received any other systemic treatment for their cancer other than the platinum-based chemo were excluded from the study. The results are now showing on the screen and were as follows: Objective response rate = 45% vs 21%, progression free survival = 6.3 months vs 2.1 months and overall survival of 12.1 months vs 9.6 months. You can see on the graph here, the separation of the curves and a hazard ratio of 0.7 In terms of the patient recorded outcomes when looking at cough, chest pain, fatigue, and loss of appetite.  Participants reported on average a 25% improvement in symptom scores across all measures. What stands out for you in that data? Dr:    It’s certainly encouraging outcomes NS:   I’m pleased to see the improvement in symptom scores, for these patients, quality of life is so important. MSL:Absolutely, it’s important that we look at the impact on patients’ lives as well as the efficacy of the treatment. Dr:    Could you just remind of the dosing again? MSL:Certainly, let me just pull the dosing slide up for you, can you see that?  The dose, is weight dependent and is an infusion, but the treatment schedule is as follows: Avant + Docetaxel every 3 weeks or Placebo + Docetaxel every 3 weeks Dr:    So you say its weight based, what’s the calculation? MSL:Its 0.2mg/kg Dr:    And how often is that given? MSL:It’s given on Day 1 of each 3-weekly cycle alongside Docetaxel. Dr:    Sally, can you make a note of that for the nurses on the chemo suite? NS:   Yes, no problem at all. ::  Do you have the Adverse Events information you can show? MSL:Yes, of course, let me just pull the slide up…. ::  Can you see the slide entitled Treatment Emergent Adverse Events? NS:   Yes, we can see that. MSL:Perfect, antibody drug conjugates tend to be well tolerated because they deliver the cytotoxic payload into the tumour cell meaning that very little goes into the healthy tissue, however like any treatment there are side effects.  What this slide shows you is the incidence of each of the reported adverse events, is there anything particular that stands out for you? NS:   Emmmm….  It actually looks like it’s generally well tolerated…  I’m quite surprised.  Are there any particular things we need to consider to mitigate the risks? MSL:Not particularly, just the usual supportive treatments you would use for patients with this stage cancer. NS:   Ok, great, thank you. MSL:Is there anything else you would like me to show you in terms of the data? Dr:    No, I think we have enough there to be going on with. MSL:Great, so in terms of next steps, how do you plan to take this forward as a team? Dr:    I think we will discuss it again at the MDT, I also need to catch up with Dr Williamson to discuss the pathology set up. MSL:What additional information or support do you need from me? Dr:    I think it would be good if you could send me the slides you have shown us today so I can reference them when discussing with ym colleagues. MSL:Of course, would you be interested in signing up to our Clinical Paper Portal which would give you access to all the clinical studies for Avant? Dr:    That sounds helpful, what would I need to do? MSL:If you’re happy for me to pass your email address on to my colleague in our Medical Information department they will create you an account and send you the link. Dr:    Yes, that would be great, thank you. MSL:I also note from the registrations that you have signed up to our upcoming webinar “The Evolution of Treatments for Advanced Lung Cancer”.  Sally, Julie – would you like me to send you the information on the webinar? JDr:  Yes please, that would be interesting. NS:   Sure, I’ll take a look. MSL:Dr Lewis – the webinar will focus on some case studies that are developing, is this something you might be interested in being involved in? Dr:    I might be, I’d need to know a bit more. MSL:Would it be ok to reach out to you after the webinar to discuss in more depth? Dr:    Yes, that would be fine. MSL:Ok, well I’m conscious of time, I will send out the webinar information and get Dr Lewis set up on the clinical paper portal.  I know you have plans to speak to your pathologist and the wider team, please do let me know if you need any support with that. Dr:    Will do, many thanks MSL:Your welcome, look forward to speaking with you all again. ALL: Bye, thanks, bye etc…", "segments": "[\"MSL:Hello Dr Lewis, can you see me, ok?

MSL:Brilliant, lovely to meet you Sally. Thanks for introducing yourselves, are we expecting anyone else? DR: I don\\u2019t think so. MSL:Great, thank you. Let me introduce myself, I\\u2019m Laurence from Pharmapro and I am here in response to a medical request you made through my colleague Louise. I would like to take you through the data regarding Avant which is licensed in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced or locally advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer that have progressed following first line treatment with platinum chemotherapy. Is that what you were expecting this meeting to be about? DR: Yes, that\\u2019s what I was hoping for! MSL:Excellent, my aim is that by the end of the presentation I will have provided you with the information you need to support your treatment decisions for your patients. I am keen to answer any questions you may have so do please ask questions as we go through the data. Dr: Great, thanks MSL:Did any of you get the opportunity to attend the virtual ASCO meeting last month? Dr: Yes, I did, it was a really great meeting MSL:Fantastic, I got to attend several of the sessions myself and was really impressed with the data and advancements in patient care that I saw. Dr: Yes, I really enjoy ASCO as there is always so much great content. MSL:What presentation stood out for you? Dr: So many of them to be honest but the ones I found most interesting were the ones with the new biomarkers, it\\u2019s incredible how much we are discovering now in terms of targets for treatment and indicators for disease. MSL:I know, it\\u2019s incredible and so promising for patients and clinicians alike. Did you attend any of the presentations about Avant or ELC testing? Dr: Yes, you couldn\\u2019t really miss it, there seemed to be a lot of studies being presented on both the drug and the testing.

Dr:    (SITS FORWARD) Where do we get the antibody from? MSL:You can order it direct from the company. Dr:    Do we need a special testing kit? MSL:You can purchase an ELC ready-to-use assay, I have a leaflet I can leave on that showing the details. Dr:    Will the pathologists understand all of this? MSL:Yes, they should be very familiar with these types of tests. Dr:    Ok, so what are the tissue requirements to be able to perform the test? MSL:That’s a good question.  As you know tissue is difficult to get in lung cancer cases and the requirements in terms of size of sample is not that high, it is more important that the sample contains as many cancer cells as possible. Dr:    So any sample is better than nothing in terms of size? MSL:I think in the discovery phase, as you build your experience, it would make sense to test as many samples as possible.  It might be worth speaking to your pathologists to check, but I would imagine their expectations in terms of tissue sample would be similar across the board. Dr:    Well I suppose so, I guess we always try to get a good sample. MSL:In terms of the cut offs, they looked at whether a sample contained 25, 50 or 75% positive tumour cells and it was deemed that the ELC expression was high if the sample contained greater than 50% of cells expressing the protein.  Which means that if 50% or more of the cancer cells in the sample expresses the protein then the drug should work. Dr:    Does that mean, we would only use Avant in those patients who have 50% or greater expression? MSL:Yes, that’s correct. Dr:    What percentage of patients would you expect to have 50% ELC expression in their tumours? MSL:The current data, which I am showing on the screen, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Professor Sykes in 2018, suggests up to 65% of advanced or locally advanced non-small cell tumours may have some expression of ELC, the level of expression within the individuals is not yet known which is why everyone who could be eligible for treatment should be tested. Dr:    Ok, I see.  Do you need to re-biopsy when they progress? MSL:The data supports use of either material from the initial biopsy or from a second biopsy following progression, as it’s difficult to get tissue for the initial diagnosis, I imagine it must be even harder the second time round.  Do you re-biopsy many patients at progression? Dr:    We do if we can, just in case the cancer has mutated, but it’s not always possible. MSL:Yes, we hear from a lot of clinicians that getting access to good tissue samples is particularly challenging. Dr:    It can be, we do a lot of EBUS at this hospital, are cytology samples ok to use? MSL If they can be formalin fixed into a block and sliced then yes Dr:    Ok, I think that’s what they do with them, maybe another one for me to check with the pathologists. (MAKES A NOTE) MSL:If you would like me to support with any of the information you want to discuss with the pathologists then please let me know. Dr:    Yes, I might need some support, will see how I get on first. MSL:Ok, so that’s it in terms of the test, is there any other information you would like to know on that matter? Dr:    I don’t think so, sounds like I need to speak to the pathologists first. MSL:No problem, and as I said I can support with any information if you need me to. NS:   We have a meeting with Dr Williamson (the pathologist) at the end of the week, would you like me to add it to the agenda? Dr:    Yes please Sally, that would be great. Dr:    Are you able to send me those slides you have? MSL:These ones on the detail around the testing requirements? Dr:    Yes, then I could forward them on to Dr Williamson MSL:Yes, that’s no problem at all, I can do that. Dr:    Thanks. MSL:When you have introduced a new diagnostic test previously, what process did you follow to ensure it was integrated with minimal disruption to the turn around times of results? Dr:    To be honest, the pathologists do most of that, we just let them know which patients need testing when we have the MDT meeting. MSL:Ok, I see, whilst I understand that the pathologists take the lead on it, is there anything that you would improve about the process you currently have for identifying which patients require which diagnostic test? Dr:    To be honest, it works pretty well, I do think we should be quicker at adopting new tests though. MSL:Is there anything specific you think that could be done? (LEANS FORWARD) Dr:    Probably not, a lot of it comes down to funding within the trust and getting things through approval. MSL:That is similar in every trust to be honest. Dr:    Yes, I think it is a standard issue. (NODS IN AGREEMENT) MSL:Shall we have a look at the data now? Dr:    Yes please MSL:Is there anything particular any of you would like me to focus on? Dr:    An overview of the phase 3 trial would be useful for me. NS:   I’d be keen to understand what side effects we are likely to see and how to manage them please. MSL:Of course, we can certainly cover that. Can everyone see the title slide with the study name on it? Dr/JDr/NS Yes (all together) MSL:The phase 3 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, and multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of Avant in combination with Docetaxel as second line therapy in patients with advanced or locally advanced NSCLC following first line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary outcomes measured were progression free survival and overall survival and the secondary outcome measured was change in patient reported outcomes. Can you tell me what the title of the slide is that you can see on the screen? Dr:    Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria MSL:Great, well as you can see, these were in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as you can see patients in the study had all progressed after 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. There were 602 patients in the study randomised to one of two arms. Any patients who had received any other systemic treatment for their cancer other than the platinum-based chemo were excluded from the study. The results are now showing on the screen and were as follows: Objective response rate = 45% vs 21%, progression free survival = 6.3 months vs 2.1 months and overall survival of 12.1 months vs 9.6 months. You can see on the graph here, the separation of the curves and a hazard ratio of 0.7 In terms of the patient recorded outcomes when looking at cough, chest pain, fatigue, and loss of appetite.  Participants reported on average a 25% improvement in symptom scores across all measures. What stands out for you in that data? Dr:    It’s certainly encouraging outcomes NS:   I’m pleased to see the improvement in symptom scores, for these patients, quality of life is so important. MSL:Absolutely, it’s important that we look at the impact on patients’ lives as well as the efficacy of the treatment. Dr:    Could you just remind of the dosing again? MSL:Certainly, let me just pull the dosing slide up for you, can you see that?  The dose, is weight dependent and is an infusion, but the treatment schedule is as follows: Avant + Docetaxel every 3 weeks or Placebo + Docetaxel every 3 weeks Dr:    So you say its weight based, what’s the calculation? MSL:Its 0.2mg/kg Dr:    And how often is that given? MSL:It’s given on Day 1 of each 3-weekly cycle alongside Docetaxel. Dr:    Sally, can you make a note of that for the nurses on the chemo suite? NS:   Yes, no problem at all. ::  Do you have the Adverse Events information you can show? MSL:Yes, of course, let me just pull the slide up…. ::  Can you see the slide entitled Treatment Emergent Adverse Events? NS:   Yes, we can see that. MSL:Perfect, antibody drug conjugates tend to be well tolerated because they deliver the cytotoxic payload into the tumour cell meaning that very little goes into the healthy tissue, however like any treatment there are side effects.  What this slide shows you is the incidence of each of the reported adverse events, is there anything particular that stands out for you? NS:   Emmmm….  It actually looks like it’s generally well tolerated…  I’m quite surprised.  Are there any particular things we need to consider to mitigate the risks? MSL:Not particularly, just the usual supportive treatments you would use for patients with this stage cancer. NS:   Ok, great, thank you. MSL:Is there anything else you would like me to show you in terms of the data? Dr:    No, I think we have enough there to be going on with. MSL:Great, so in terms of next steps, how do you plan to take this forward as a team? Dr:    I think we will discuss it again at the MDT, I also need to catch up with Dr Williamson to discuss the pathology set up. MSL:What additional information or support do you need from me? Dr:    I think it would be good if you could send me the slides you have shown us today so I can reference them when discussing with ym colleagues. MSL:Of course, would you be interested in signing up to our Clinical Paper Portal which would give you access to all the clinical studies for Avant? Dr:    That sounds helpful, what would I need to do? MSL:If you’re happy for me to pass your email address on to my colleague in our Medical Information department they will create you an account and send you the link. Dr:    Yes, that would be great, thank you. MSL:I also note from the registrations that you have signed up to our upcoming webinar “The Evolution of Treatments for Advanced Lung Cancer”.  Sally, Julie – would you like me to send you the information on the webinar? JDr:  Yes please, that would be interesting. NS:   Sure, I’ll take a look. MSL:Dr Lewis – the webinar will focus on some case studies that are developing, is this something you might be interested in being involved in? Dr:    I might be, I’d need to know a bit more. MSL:Would it be ok to reach out to you after the webinar to discuss in more depth? Dr:    Yes, that would be fine. MSL:Ok, well I’m conscious of time, I will send out the webinar information and get Dr Lewis set up on the clinical paper portal.  I know you have plans to speak to your pathologist and the wider team, please do let me know if you need any support with that. Dr:    Will do, many thanks MSL:Your welcome, look forward to speaking with you all again. ALL: Bye, thanks, bye etc…", "segments": "[\"MSL:Hello Dr Lewis, can you see me, ok? (WAVES) Dr: Hello, yes I can. (WAVES BACK) MSL:Can I just check who else we have in the meeting please? DR: Yes, of course, does everyone want to introduce themselves? JDr: Hi, I\\u2019m Julie one of the junior doctors working alongside Dr Lewis at the moment. MSL:Great to meet you Julie, can I ask what stage you\\u2019re at in your training? JDr: Sure, I\\u2019m an F2 so still pretty early on. MSL:Well it\\u2019s great to meet you, thanks for joining the meeting. NS: Hi, I\\u2019m Sally the Lung Specialist Nurse. MSL:Brilliant, lovely to meet you Sally. Thanks for introducing yourselves, are we expecting anyone else? DR: I don\\u2019t think so. MSL:Great, thank you. Let me introduce myself, I\\u2019m Laurence from Pharmapro and I am here in response to a medical request you made through my colleague Louise. I would like to take you through the data regarding Avant which is licensed in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced or locally advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer that have progressed following first line treatment with platinum chemotherapy. Is that what you were expecting this meeting to be about? DR: Yes, that\\u2019s what I was hoping for! MSL:Excellent, my aim is that by the end of the presentation I will have provided you with the information you need to support your treatment decisions for your patients. I am keen to answer any questions you may have so do please ask questions as we go through the data. Dr: Great, thanks MSL:Did any of you get the opportunity to attend the virtual ASCO meeting last month? Dr: Yes, I did, it was a really great meeting MSL:Fantastic, I got to attend several of the sessions myself and was really impressed with the data and advancements in patient care that I saw. Dr: Yes, I really enjoy ASCO as there is always so much great content. MSL:What presentation stood out for you? Dr: So many of them to be honest but the ones I found most interesting were the ones with the new biomarkers, it\\u2019s incredible how much we are discovering now in terms of targets for treatment and indicators for disease. MSL:I know, it\\u2019s incredible and so promising for patients and clinicians alike. Did you attend any of the presentations about Avant or ELC testing? Dr: Yes, you couldn\\u2019t really miss it, there seemed to be a lot of studies being presented on both the drug and the testing. MSL:Yeah, there\\u2019s a significant level of interest in exploring what both the treatment and the test can offer lung cancer patients who have advanced disease, as you know, these patients can be very challenging to manage. Can I ask what you remember from the presentations you observed? Dr: Of course, I know that your phase 3 study showed an improvement in progression free survival as well as overall survival and I understand that the particular protein the drug targets \\u2026 sorry I can\\u2019t remember the name of the protein, but the protein is present in over 50% of patients \\u2013 is that correct? MSL:Fantastic, it sounds like you have a good handle on the key elements, can I just ask your colleagues how much they know about Avant? Julie? Sally? JDr: I have to admit I know very little about this treatment, so I am looking forward to learning from you. NS: I have heard bits and bobs and I know as a team we are looking to start testing so it would be helpful to know a bit more. MSL:Ok, great, well if this works for you, I propose that I take you through the data and the testing set up and then we can leave some time for any questions you may have, should take about 15 minutes, does that sound ok? Dr: Perfect, thank you. MSL:Can I ask what discussions you have had to date with the other consultants about it? Dr: Well after ASCO, I brought it up at a recent MDT meeting we had. MSL:Was that in relation to a specific patient you were discussing? Dr: No, not really MSL:Ok, just a general conversation about treatment options? Dr: (NODS) Yeah, pretty much. MSL:In terms of the testing element, what information are you looking for specifically? Dr: (SCRATCHES HEAD/THINKS) Best method of testing for the protein and the sensitivity of the test are both important to know.

Good to see you. HCP-P Morning Dr Kinski. Good to see you too. How are you? HCP I’m good, thanks for asking, busy as always but otherwise good. HCP-P Ah, busy is a way of life these days, isn’t it? HCP It certainly is! HCP-P Well thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I know we discussed GABODERM last time we met, and we covered some of the basics, but I really believe it’s an outstanding drug that could be life changing for the right patients. Could we revisit your adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis please? I’d love you to have the confidence to want to try GABODERM in one of these patients if that is okay with you? HCP Yes, of course. HCP-P Last time we met, you mentioned that you were one of the first to try secretamab and it had become one of your routine treatments for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. HCP Yes, that’s right. HCP-P Could you tell me what was it that triggered you to try it for the first time and what did you see that made you decide to make it one of your mainstay treatments? HCP Well, let me think. I seem to remember it was one of the first new treatments we had for plaque psoriasis for years, and we’d not really had anything that effective. We had to try a whole gamut of treatments in combination to achieve any kind of significant improvement for patients, emollients, steroids, UV. So, when I saw the data for secretamab, it was outstanding and compared to what we’d experienced before, I just had to try it. From there, it lived up to my, kind of reserved expectations and I was truly amazed. It’s been a mainstay ever since. HCP-P Thank you, for sharing that. There have been other new products launched in this area since, but you don’t seem to have adopted any of those, what would a new treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis have to demonstrate for you to have that “I must try it” moment again? HCP It really has to offer something significant in terms of efficacy. Clear space between it and secretamab. HCP-P And when you say efficacy, what would that be for you? PASI 90, speed, what exactly for you? HCP With secretamab it was initially PASI 90, it was just so far out ahead of what we had at the time. Otherwise, the things I’m looking for are initial speed of action and sustained effectiveness, I don’t want it waring off in other words. HCP-P Okay, so if I want you to have that “I must try it” moment again, I need to demonstrate efficacy, PASI 90 and if possible significant improvements over current treatment. Speed of action and that it will not ware off over time. Is that correct? HCP Yes if you can do that I’ll be impressed. HCP-P Okay, I think I can, let me show you the RADIANT Study. Now, although this is a UCB sponsored study, it was peer reviewed and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2021. It was a head to head, double-blind randomised study of 743 moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients compared to secretamab, which you have been routinely using. It this okay to present? HCP Yes, it’s not very often we get new drugs compared to something we routinely use, so yes I’m very interested to see what it says. HCP-P Well, here the Y-axis shows the percentage of patients achieving PASI 90 and the X-axis shows the number of weeks of treatment. What you can see is that GABODERM moves ahead of secretamab quite early and by week 4, 34.9% of patients have achieved PASI 90 compared to just 17.5% of the secretamab group. Any comments yet? HCP Not yet, please carry on. HCP-P The separation is maintained and significant, the P-Value was less than zero point zero zero one! So, achieves really good PASI 90 and has significant superiority to secretamab, the speed of action shows separation early and is significant at week 4 and the efficacy is maintained over time as you can see. No waring off. Also, as you can see a high percentage of patients respond excellently to GABODERM. What do you think now? HCP I think. I think I probably should try it. HCP-P That’d be great. HCP So, it does raise a few questions, how do I prescribe and administer GABODERM and is there anything I need to be aware of. You know, side effects, etc. HCP-P So, ideally, we’d suggest using it in a biologic naïve patient, so you can see just how good it is and… HCP I’m not sure I’d use it for the first time in a biologic naïve patient, but I do have a couple in mind who’ve been struggling on their current biologics. HCP-P Okay, that’s great. So, how to prescribe and administer. HCP-P It’s an initial 5 doses, similar to other biologics and then switching to an 8 week interval for maintenance. Overall, it’s eight less than secretamab in the first year and less on an ongoing basis, which patients will love. HCP Well that’s easy. HCP-P It comes in a handy autoinjector, so patients can do this themselves at home, once you’ve trained them. HCP Excellent, and side effects. HCP-P Similar to the others, apart from you may see candidiasis in up to 1 in 8 patients, but it’s transient and can be treated with a simple antifungal. In the studies, we saw very few people stop treatment due to this. HCP Okay, that all seems very straight forward. HCP-P Do you have a patient in mind and how will you ensure they receive GABODERM? HCP I do have someone in mind, but I know they’re not due in for a couple of weeks. Also, although I’ll see the patient, it’ll be the nurse that administers the first dose and has responsibility for training the patient. HCP-P Well, could we book a meeting for you to meet the nurse and ensure she has everything she needs to start that patient on GABODERM? HCP Yes, let’s do that. HCP-P Excellent, also, it’s important for you to see how well GABODERM works if it’s going to become one of your routine treatments. Could, we book another meeting a couple of weeks after the patient commences treatment so we can check the patients progress? I really want you to see how fast GABODERM works. HCP DIARIES COMPLETED AND DATE AGREED Yes, let’s book that when you come in to see the nurse. HCP-P Excellent. I’ll see you then", "segments": "[\"HCP Morning, Lukas/ Birgit. Good to see you. HCP-P Morning Dr Kinski. Good to see you too. How are you? HCP I\\u2019m good, thanks for asking, busy as always but otherwise good. HCP-P Ah, busy is a way of life these days, isn\\u2019t it? HCP It certainly is! HCP-P Well thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I know we discussed GABODERM last time we met, and we covered some of the basics, but I really believe it\\u2019s an outstanding drug that could be life changing for the right patients. Could we revisit your adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis please? I\\u2019d love you to have the confidence to want to try GABODERM in one of these patients if that is okay with you? HCP Yes, of course. HCP-P Last time we met, you mentioned that you were one of the first to try secretamab and it had become one of your routine treatments for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. HCP Yes, that\\u2019s right. HCP-P Could you tell me what was it that triggered you to try it for the first time and what did you see that made you decide to make it one of your mainstay treatments? HCP Well, let me think. I seem to remember it was one of the first new treatments we had for plaque psoriasis for years, and we\\u2019d not really had anything that effective. We had to try a whole gamut of treatments in combination to achieve any kind of significant improvement for patients, emollients, steroids, UV. So, when I saw the data for secretamab, it was outstanding and compared to what we\\u2019d experienced before, I just had to try it. From there, it lived up to my, kind of reserved expectations and I was truly amazed. It\\u2019s been a mainstay ever since. HCP-P Thank you, for sharing that. There have been other new products launched in this area since, but you don\\u2019t seem to have adopted any of those, what would a new treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis have to demonstrate for you to have that \\u201cI must try it\\u201d moment again? HCP It really has to offer something significant in terms of efficacy. Clear space between it and secretamab. HCP-P And when you say efficacy, what would that be for you? PASI 90, speed, what exactly for you? HCP With secretamab it was initially PASI 90, it was just so far out ahead of what we had at the time. Otherwise, the things I\\u2019m looking for are initial speed of action and sustained effectiveness, I don\\u2019t want it waring off in other words. HCP-P Okay, so if I want you to have that \\u201cI must try it\\u201d moment again, I need to demonstrate efficacy, PASI 90 and if possible significant improvements over current treatment. Speed of action and that it will not ware off over time. Is that correct? HCP Yes if you can do that I\\u2019ll be impressed. HCP-P Okay, I think I can, let me show you the RADIANT Study. Now, although this is a UCB sponsored study, it was peer reviewed and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2021. It was a head to head, double-blind randomised study of 743 moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients compared to secretamab, which you have been routinely using. It this okay to present? HCP Yes, it\\u2019s not very often we get new drugs compared to something we routinely use, so yes I\\u2019m very interested to see what it says. HCP-P Well, here the Y-axis shows the percentage of patients achieving PASI 90 and the X-axis shows the number of weeks of treatment. What you can see is that GABODERM moves ahead of secretamab quite early and by week 4, 34.9% of patients have achieved PASI 90 compared to just 17.5% of the secretamab group. Any comments yet? HCP Not yet, please carry on. HCP-P The separation is maintained and significant, the P-Value was less than zero point zero zero one! So, achieves really good PASI 90 and has significant superiority to secretamab, the speed of action shows separation early and is significant at week 4 and the efficacy is maintained over time as you can see. No waring off. Also, as you can see a high percentage of patients respond excellently to GABODERM. What do you think now? HCP I think. I think I probably should try it. HCP-P That\\u2019d be great. HCP So, it does raise a few questions, how do I prescribe and administer GABODERM and is there anything I need to be aware of. You know, side effects, etc. HCP-P So, ideally, we\\u2019d suggest using it in a biologic na\\u00efve patient, so you can see just how good it is and\\u2026 HCP I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019d use it for the first time in a biologic na\\u00efve patient, but I do have a couple in mind who\\u2019ve been struggling on their current biologics. HCP-P Okay, that\\u2019s great. So, how to prescribe and administer. HCP-P It\\u2019s an initial 5 doses, similar to other biologics and then switching to an 8 week interval for maintenance. Overall, it\\u2019s eight less than secretamab in the first year and less on an ongoing basis, which patients will love. HCP Well that\\u2019s easy. HCP-P It comes in a handy autoinjector, so patients can do this themselves at home, once you\\u2019ve trained them. HCP Excellent, and side effects. HCP-P Similar to the others, apart from you may see candidiasis in up to 1 in 8 patients, but it\\u2019s transient and can be treated with a simple antifungal. In the studies, we saw very few people stop treatment due to this. HCP Okay, that all seems very straight forward. HCP-P Do you have a patient in mind and how will you ensure they receive GABODERM? HCP I do have someone in mind, but I know they\\u2019re not due in for a couple of weeks. Also, although I\\u2019ll see the patient, it\\u2019ll be the nurse that administers the first dose and has responsibility for training the patient. HCP-P Well, could we book a meeting for you to meet the nurse and ensure she has everything she needs to start that patient on GABODERM? HCP Yes, let\\u2019s do that.

No waring off. Also, as you can see a high percentage of patients respond excellently to GABODERM. What do you think now? HCP I think. I think I probably should try it. HCP-P That\\u2019d be great. HCP So, it does raise a few questions, how do I prescribe and administer GABODERM and is there anything I need to be aware of. You know, side effects, etc. HCP-P So, ideally, we\\u2019d suggest using it in a biologic na\\u00efve patient, so you can see just how good it is and\\u2026 HCP I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019d use it for the first time in a biologic na\\u00efve patient, but I do have a couple in mind who\\u2019ve been struggling on their current biologics. HCP-P Okay, that\\u2019s great. So, how to prescribe and administer. HCP-P It\\u2019s an initial 5 doses, similar to other biologics and then switching to an 8 week interval for maintenance. Overall, it\\u2019s eight less than secretamab in the first year and less on an ongoing basis, which patients will love. HCP Well that\\u2019s easy. HCP-P It comes in a handy autoinjector, so patients can do this themselves at home, once you\\u2019ve trained them. HCP Excellent, and side effects. HCP-P Similar to the others, apart from you may see candidiasis in up to 1 in 8 patients, but it\\u2019s transient and can be treated with a simple antifungal. In the studies, we saw very few people stop treatment due to this. HCP Okay, that all seems very straight forward. HCP-P Do you have a patient in mind and how will you ensure they receive GABODERM? HCP I do have someone in mind, but I know they\\u2019re not due in for a couple of weeks. Also, although I\\u2019ll see the patient, it\\u2019ll be the nurse that administers the first dose and has responsibility for training the patient. HCP-P Well, could we book a meeting for you to meet the nurse and ensure she has everything she needs to start that patient on GABODERM? HCP Yes, let\\u2019s do that. HCP-P Excellent, also, it\\u2019s important for you to see how well GABODERM works if it\\u2019s going to become one of your routine treatments. Could, we book another meeting a couple of weeks after the patient commences treatment so we can check the patients progress? I really want you to see how fast GABODERM works. HCP DIARIES COMPLETED AND DATE AGREED Yes, let\\u2019s book that when you come in to see the nurse. HCP-P Excellent. I\\u2019ll see you then\"]", "docker_feteched": true, "created_at": "2024-05-20T09:16:22.271Z"}}, {"model": "analysis.transcription", "pk": 11, "fields": {"text": "Speaker 0 00:00:00 Dieser Anruf wird

DR Yes of course does everyone want to introduce themselves JDr Hi Im Julie one of the junior doctors working alongside Dr Lewis at the moment MSL Great to meet you Julie can I ask what stage youre at in your training JDr Sure Im an F2 so still pretty early on MSL Well its great to meet you thanks for joining the meeting NS Hi Im Sally the Lung Specialist Nurse MSL Brilliant lovely to meet you Sally Thanks for introducing yourselves are we expecting anyone else DR I dont think so MSL Great thank you Let me introduce myself Im Laurence from Pharmapro and I am here in response to a medical request you made through my colleague Louise I would like to take you through the data regarding Avant which is licensed in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced or locally advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer that have progressed following first line treatment with platinum chemotherapy Is that what you were expecting this meeting to be about DR Yes thats what I was hoping for MSL Excellent my aim is that by the end of the presentation I will have provided you with the information you need to support your treatment decisions for your patients I am keen to answer any questions you may have so do please ask questions as we go through the data Dr Great thanks MSL Did any of you get the opportunity to attend the virtual ASCO meeting last month Dr Yes I did it was a really great meeting MSL Fantastic I got to attend several of the sessions myself and was really impressed with the data and advancements in patient care that I saw Dr Yes I really enjoy ASCO as there is always so much great content MSL What presentation stood out for you Dr So many of them to be honest but the ones I found most interesting were the ones with the new biomarkers its incredible how much we are discovering now in terms of targets for treatment and indicators for disease MSL I know its incredible and so promising for patients and clinicians alike Did you attend any of the presentations about Avant or ELC testing Dr Yes you couldnt really miss it there seemed to be a lot of studies being presented on both the drug and the testing MSL Yeah theres a significant level of interest in exploring what both the treatment and the test can offer lung cancer patients who have advanced disease as you know these patients can be very challenging to manage Can I ask what you remember from the presentations you observed Dr Of course I know that your phase 3 study showed an improvement in progression free survival as well as overall survival and I understand that the particular protein the drug targets sorry I cant remember the name of the protein but the protein is present in over 50 of patients is that correct MSL Fantastic it sounds like you have a good handle on the key elements can I just ask your colleagues how much they know about Avant Julie Sally JDr I have to admit I know very little about this treatment so I am looking forward to learning from you NS I have heard bits and bobs and I know as a team we are looking to start testing so it would be helpful to know a bit more MSL Ok great well if this works for you I propose that I take you through the data and the testing set up and then we can leave some time for any questions you may have should take about 15 minutes does that sound ok Dr Perfect thank you MSL Can I ask what discussions you have had to date with the other consultants about it Dr Well after ASCO I brought it up at a recent MDT meeting we had MSL Was that in relation to a specific patient you were discussing Dr No not really MSL Ok just a general conversation about treatment options Dr NODS Yeah pretty much MSL In terms of the testing element what information are you looking for specifically Dr SCRATCHES HEADTHINKS Best method of testing for the protein and the sensitivity of the test are both important to know MSL NODS Ok I have a few slides on that here As you may be aware its a simple immunohistochemistry test you just need access to the antibody Dr SITS FORWARD Where do we get the antibody from MSL You can order it direct from the company Dr Do we need a special testing kit MSL You can purchase an ELC readytouse assay I have a leaflet I can leave on that showing the details Dr Will the pathologists understand all of this MSL Yes they should be very familiar with these types of tests Dr Ok so what are the tissue requirements to be able to perform the test MSL Thats a good question As you know tissue is difficult to get in lung cancer cases and the requirements in terms of size of sample is not that high it is more important that the sample contains as many cancer cells as possible Dr So any sample is better than nothing in terms of size MSL I think in the discovery phase as you build your experience it would make sense to test as many samples as possible It might be worth speaking to your pathologists to check but I would imagine their expectations in terms of tissue sample would be similar across the board Dr Well I suppose so I guess we always try to get a good sample MSL In terms of the cut offs they looked at whether a sample contained 25 50 or 75 positive tumour cells and it was deemed that the ELC expression was high if the sample contained greater than 50 of cells expressing the protein Which means that if 50 or more of the cancer cells in the sample expresses the protein then the drug should work Dr Does that mean we would only use Avant in those patients who have 50 or greater expression MSL Yes thats correct Dr What percentage of patients would you expect to have 50 ELC expression in their tumours MSL The current data which I am showing on the screen which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Professor Sykes in 2018 suggests up to 65 of advanced or locally advanced nonsmall cell tumours may have some expression of ELC the level of expression within the individuals is not yet known which is why everyone who could be eligible for treatment should be tested Dr Ok I see Do you need to rebiopsy when they progress MSL The data supports use of either material from the initial biopsy or from a second biopsy following progression as its difficult to get tissue for the initial diagnosis I imagine it must be even harder the second time round Do you rebiopsy many patients at progression Dr We do if we can just in case the cancer has mutated but its not always possible MSL Yes we hear from a lot of clinicians that getting access to good tissue samples is particularly challenging Dr It can be we do a lot of EBUS at this hospital are cytology samples ok to use MSL If they can be formalin fixed into a block and sliced then yes Dr Ok I think thats what they do with them maybe another one for me to check with the pathologists MAKES A NOTE MSL If you would like me to support with any of the information you want to discuss with the pathologists then please let me know Dr Yes I might need some support will see how I get on first MSL Ok so thats it in terms of the test is there any other information you would like to know on that matter Dr I dont think so sounds like I need to speak to the pathologists first MSL No problem and as I said I can support with any information if you need me to NS We have a meeting with Dr Williamson the pathologist at the end of the week would you like me to add it to the agenda Dr Yes please Sally that would be great Dr Are you able to send me those slides you have MSL These ones on the detail around the testing requirements Dr Yes then I could forward them on to Dr Williamson MSL Yes thats no problem at all I can do that Dr Thanks MSL When you have introduced a new diagnostic test previously what process did you follow to ensure it was integrated with minimal disruption to the turn around times of results Dr To be honest the pathologists do most of that we just let them know which patients need testing when we have the MDT meeting MSL Ok I see whilst I understand that the pathologists take the lead on it is there anything that you would improve about the process you currently have for identifying which patients require which diagnostic test Dr To be honest it works pretty well I do think we should be quicker at adopting new tests though MSL Is there anything specific you think that could be done LEANS FORWARD Dr Probably not a lot of it comes down to funding within the trust and getting things through approval MSL That is similar in every trust to be honest Dr Yes I think it is a standard issue NODS IN AGREEMENT MSL Shall we have a look at the data now Dr Yes please MSL Is there anything particular any of you would like me to focus on Dr An overview of the phase 3 trial would be useful for me NS Id be keen to understand what side effects we are likely to see and how to manage them please MSL Of course we can certainly cover that Can everyone see the title slide with the study name on it DrJDrNS Yes all together MSL The phase 3 study was a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled multinational and multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of Avant in combination with Docetaxel as second line therapy in patients with advanced or locally advanced NSCLC following first line treatment with platinumbased chemotherapy The primary outcomes measured were progression free survival and overall survival and the secondary outcome measured was change in patient reported outcomes Can you tell me what the title of the slide is that you can see on the screen Dr InclusionExclusion Criteria MSL Great well as you can see these were in the inclusion and exclusion criteria as you can see patients in the study had all progressed after 6 cycles of platinumbased chemotherapy There were 602 patients in the study randomised to one of two arms Any patients who had received any other systemic treatment for their cancer other than the platinumbased chemo were excluded from the study The results are now showing on the screen and were as follows: Objective response rate 45 vs 21 progression free survival 63 months vs 21 months and overall survival of 121 months vs 96 months You can see on the graph here the separation of the curves and a hazard ratio of 07 In terms of the patient recorded outcomes when looking at cough chest pain fatigue and loss of appetite Participants reported on average a 25 improvement in symptom scores across all measures What stands out for you in that data Dr Its certainly encouraging outcomes NS Im pleased to see the improvement in symptom scores for these patients quality of life is so important MSL Absolutely its important that we look at the impact on patients lives as well as the efficacy of the treatment Dr Could you just remind of the dosing again MSL Certainly let me just pull the dosing slide up for you can you see that The dose is weight dependent and is an infusion but the treatment schedule is as follows: Avant Docetaxel every 3 weeks or Placebo Docetaxel every 3 weeks Dr So you say its weight based whats the calculation MSL Its 02mgkg Dr And how often is that given MSL Its given on Day 1 of each 3weekly cycle alongside Docetaxel Dr Sally can you make a note of that for the nurses on the chemo suite NS Yes no problem at all Do you have the Adverse Events information you can show MSL Yes of course let me just pull the slide up Can you see the slide entitled Treatment Emergent Adverse Events NS Yes we can see that MSL Perfect antibody drug conjugates tend to be well tolerated because they deliver the cytotoxic payload into the tumour cell meaning that very little goes into the healthy tissue however like any treatment there are side effects What this slide shows you is the incidence of each of the reported adverse events is there anything particular that stands out for you NS Emmmm It actually looks like its generally well tolerated Im quite surprised Are there any particular things we need to consider to mitigate the risks MSL Not particularly just the usual supportive treatments you would use for patients with this stage cancer NS Ok great thank you MSL Is there anything else you would like me to show you in terms of the data Dr No I think we have enough there to be going on with MSL Great so in terms of next steps how do you plan to take this forward as a team Dr I think we will discuss it again at the MDT I also need to catch up with Dr Williamson to discuss the pathology set up MSL What additional information or support do you need from me Dr I think it would be good if you could send me the slides you have shown us today so I can reference them when discussing with ym colleagues MSL Of course would you be interested in signing up to our Clinical Paper Portal which would give you access to all the clinical studies for Avant Dr That sounds helpful what would I need to do MSL If youre happy for me to pass your email address on to my colleague in our Medical Information department they will create you an account and send you the link Dr Yes that would be great thank you MSL I also note from the registrations that you have signed up to our upcoming webinar The Evolution of Treatments for Advanced Lung Cancer Sally Julie would you like me to send you the information on the webinar JDr Yes please that would be interesting NS Sure Ill take a look MSL Dr Lewis the webinar will focus on some case studies that are developing is this something you might be interested in being involved in Dr I might be Id need to know a bit more MSL Would it be ok to reach out to you after the webinar to discuss in more depth Dr Yes that would be fine MSL Ok well Im conscious of time I will send out the webinar information and get Dr Lewis set up on the clinical paper portal I know you have plans to speak to your pathologist and the wider team please do let me know if you need any support with that Dr Will do many thanks MSL Your welcome look forward to speaking with you all again ALL Bye thanks bye etc", "segments": "[\"MSL Hello Dr Lewis can you

Great thank you Let me introduce myself Im Laurence from Pharmapro and I am here in response to a medical request you made through my colleague Louise I would like to take you through the data regarding Avant which is licensed in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced or locally advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer that have progressed following first line treatment with

with the information you need to support your treatment decisions for your patients I am keen to answer any questions you may have so do please ask questions as we go through the data Dr Great thanks MSL Did any of you get the opportunity to attend the virtual ASCO meeting last month Dr Yes I did it was a really great meeting MSL Fantastic I got to attend several of the sessions myself and was really impressed with the data and advancements in patient care that I saw Dr Yes I really enjoy ASCO as there is always so much great content MSL What presentation stood out for you Dr So many of them to be honest but the ones I found most interesting were the ones with the new biomarkers its incredible how much we are discovering now in terms of targets for treatment and indicators for disease MSL I know its incredible and so promising for patients and clinicians alike Did you attend any of the presentations about Avant or ELC testing Dr Yes you couldnt really miss it there seemed to be a lot of studies being presented on both the drug and the testing MSL Yeah theres a significant level of interest in exploring what both the treatment and the test can offer lung cancer patients who have advanced disease as you know these patients can be very challenging to manage Can I ask what you remember from the presentations you observed Dr Of course I know that your phase 3 study showed an improvement in progression free survival as well as overall survival and I understand that the particular protein the drug targets sorry I cant remember the name of the protein but the protein is present in over 50 of patients is that correct MSL Fantastic it sounds like you have a good handle on the key elements can I just ask your colleagues how much they know about Avant Julie Sally JDr I have to admit I know very little about this treatment so I am looking forward to learning from you NS I have heard bits and bobs and I know as a team we are looking to start testing so it would be helpful to know a bit more MSL Ok great well if this works for you I propose that I take you through the data and the testing set up and then we can leave some time for any questions you may have should take about 15 minutes does that sound ok Dr Perfect thank you MSL Can I ask what discussions you have had to date with the other consultants about it Dr Well after ASCO I brought it up at

well Im conscious of time I will send out the webinar information and get Dr Lewis set up on the clinical paper portal I know you have plans to speak to your pathologist and the wider team please do let me know if you need any support with that Dr Will do many thanks MSL Your welcome look forward to speaking with you all again ALL Bye thanks bye etc", "segments": "[\"MSL Hello Dr Lewis can you see me ok WAVES Dr Hello yes I can WAVES BACK MSL Can I just check who else we have in the meeting please DR Yes of course does everyone want to introduce themselves JDr Hi Im Julie one of the junior doctors working alongside Dr Lewis at the moment MSL Great to meet you Julie can I ask what stage youre at in your training JDr Sure Im an F2 so still pretty early on MSL Well its great to meet you thanks for joining the meeting NS Hi Im Sally the Lung Specialist Nurse MSL Brilliant lovely to meet you Sally Thanks for introducing yourselves are we expecting anyone else DR I dont think so MSL Great thank you Let me introduce myself Im Laurence from Pharmapro and I am here in response to a medical request you made through my colleague Louise I would like to take you through the data regarding Avant which is licensed in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced or locally advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer that have progressed following first line treatment with platinum chemotherapy Is that what you were expecting this meeting to be about DR Yes thats what I was hoping for MSL Excellent my aim is that by the end of the presentation I will have provided you with the information you need to support your treatment decisions for your patients I am keen to answer any questions you may have so do please ask questions as we go through the data Dr Great thanks MSL Did any of you get the opportunity to attend the virtual ASCO meeting last month Dr Yes I did it was a really great meeting MSL Fantastic I got to attend several of the sessions myself and was really impressed with the data and advancements in patient care that I saw Dr Yes I really enjoy ASCO as there is always so much great content MSL What presentation stood out for you Dr So many of them to be honest but the ones I found most interesting were the ones with the new biomarkers its incredible how much we are discovering now in terms of targets for treatment and indicators for disease MSL I know its incredible and so promising for patients and clinicians alike Did you attend any of the presentations about Avant or ELC testing Dr Yes you couldnt really miss it there seemed to be a lot of studies being presented on both the drug and the testing MSL Yeah theres a significant level of interest in exploring what both the treatment and the test can offer lung cancer patients who have advanced disease as you know these patients can be very challenging to manage Can I ask what you remember from the presentations you observed Dr Of course I know that your phase 3 study showed an improvement in progression free survival as well as overall survival and I understand that the particular protein the drug targets sorry I cant remember the name of the protein but the protein is present in over 50 of patients is that correct MSL Fantastic it sounds like you have a good handle on the key elements can I just ask your colleagues how much they know about Avant Julie Sally JDr I have to admit I know very little about this treatment so I am looking forward to learning from you NS I have heard bits and bobs and I know as a team we are looking to start testing so it would be helpful to know a bit more MSL Ok great well if this works for you I propose that I take you through the data and the testing set up and then we can leave some time for any questions you may have should take about 15 minutes does that sound ok Dr Perfect thank you MSL Can I ask what discussions you have had to date with the other consultants about it Dr Well after ASCO I brought it up at a recent MDT meeting we had MSL Was that in relation to a specific patient you were discussing Dr No not really MSL Ok just a general conversation about treatment options Dr NODS Yeah pretty much MSL In terms of the testing element what information are you looking for specifically Dr SCRATCHES HEADTHINKS Best method of testing for the protein and the sensitivity of the test are both important to know MSL NODS Ok I have a few slides on that here As you may be aware its a simple immunohistochemistry test you just need access to the antibody Dr SITS FORWARD Where do we get the antibody from MSL You can order it direct from the company Dr Do we need a special testing kit MSL You can purchase an ELC readytouse assay I have a leaflet I can leave on that showing the details Dr Will the pathologists understand all of this MSL Yes they should be very familiar with these types of tests Dr Ok so what are the tissue requirements to be able to perform the test MSL Thats a good question As you know tissue is difficult to get in lung cancer cases and the requirements in terms of size of sample is not that high it is more important that the sample contains as many cancer cells as possible Dr So any sample is better than nothing in terms of size MSL I think in the discovery phase as you build your experience it would make sense to test as many samples as possible It might be worth speaking to your pathologists to check but I would imagine their expectations in terms of tissue sample would be similar across the board Dr Well I suppose so I guess we always try to get a good sample MSL In terms of the cut offs they looked at whether a sample contained 25 50 or 75 positive tumour cells and it was deemed that the ELC expression was high if the sample contained greater than 50 of cells expressing the protein Which means that if 50 or more of the cancer cells in the sample expresses the protein then the drug should work Dr Does that mean we would only use Avant in those patients who have 50 or greater expression MSL Yes thats correct Dr What percentage of patients would you expect to have 50 ELC expression in their tumours MSL The current data which I am showing on the screen which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Professor Sykes in 2018 suggests up to 65 of advanced or locally advanced nonsmall cell tumours may have some expression of ELC the level of expression within the individuals is not yet known which is why everyone who could be eligible for treatment should be tested Dr Ok I see Do you need to rebiopsy when they progress MSL The data supports use of either material from the initial biopsy or from a second biopsy following progression as its difficult to get tissue for the initial diagnosis I imagine it must be even harder the second time round Do you rebiopsy many patients at progression Dr We do if we can just in case the cancer has mutated but its not always possible MSL Yes we hear from a lot of clinicians that getting access to good tissue samples is particularly challenging Dr It can be we do a lot of EBUS at this hospital are cytology samples ok to use MSL If they can be formalin fixed into a block and sliced then yes Dr Ok I think thats what they do with them maybe another one for me to check with the pathologists MAKES A NOTE MSL If you would like me to support with any of the information you want to discuss with the pathologists then please let me know Dr Yes I might need some support will see how I get on first MSL Ok so thats it in terms of the test is there any other information you would like to know on that matter Dr I dont think so sounds like I need to speak to the pathologists first MSL No problem and as I said I can support with any information if you need me to NS We have a meeting with Dr Williamson the pathologist at the end of the week would you like me to add it to the agenda Dr Yes please Sally that would be great Dr Are you able to send me those slides you have MSL These ones on the detail around the testing requirements Dr Yes then I could forward them on to Dr Williamson MSL Yes thats no problem at all I can do that Dr Thanks MSL When you have introduced a new diagnostic test previously what process did you follow to ensure it was integrated with minimal disruption to the turn around times of results Dr To be honest the pathologists do most of that we just let them know which patients need testing when we have the MDT meeting MSL Ok I see whilst I understand that the pathologists take the lead on it is there anything that you would improve about the process you currently have for identifying which patients require which diagnostic test Dr To be honest it works pretty well I do think we should be quicker at adopting new tests though MSL Is there anything specific you think that could be done LEANS FORWARD Dr Probably not a lot of it comes down to funding within the trust and getting things through approval MSL That is similar in every trust to be honest Dr Yes I think it is a standard issue NODS IN AGREEMENT MSL Shall we have a look at the data now Dr Yes please MSL Is there anything particular any of you would like me to focus on Dr An overview of the phase 3 trial would be useful for me NS Id be keen to understand what side effects we are likely to see and how to manage them please MSL Of course we can certainly cover that Can everyone see the title slide with the study name on it DrJDrNS Yes all together MSL The phase 3 study was a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled multinational and multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of Avant in combination with Docetaxel as second line therapy in patients with advanced or locally advanced NSCLC following first line treatment with platinumbased chemotherapy The primary outcomes measured were progression free survival and overall survival and the secondary outcome measured was change in patient reported outcomes Can you tell me what the title of the slide is that you can see on the screen Dr InclusionExclusion Criteria MSL Great well as you can see these were in the inclusion and exclusion criteria as you can see patients in the study had all progressed after 6 cycles of platinumbased chemotherapy There were 602 patients in the study randomised to one of two arms Any patients who had received any other systemic treatment for their cancer other than the platinumbased chemo were excluded from the study The results are now showing on the screen and were as follows: Objective response rate 45 vs 21 progression free survival 63 months vs 21 months and overall survival of 121 months vs 96 months You can see on the graph here the separation of the curves and a hazard ratio of 07 In terms of the patient recorded outcomes when looking at cough chest pain fatigue and loss of appetite Participants reported on average a 25 improvement in symptom scores across all measures What stands out for you in that data Dr Its certainly encouraging outcomes NS Im pleased to see the improvement in symptom scores for these patients quality of life is so important MSL Absolutely its important that we look at the impact on patients lives as well as the efficacy of the treatment Dr Could you just remind of the dosing again MSL Certainly let me just pull the dosing slide up for you can you see that The dose is weight dependent and is an infusion but the treatment schedule is as follows: Avant Docetaxel every 3 weeks or Placebo Docetaxel every 3 weeks Dr So you say its weight based whats the calculation MSL Its 02mgkg Dr And how often is that given MSL Its given on Day 1 of each 3weekly cycle alongside Docetaxel Dr Sally can you make a note of that for the nurses on the chemo suite NS Yes no problem at all Do you have the Adverse Events information you can show MSL Yes of course let me just pull the slide up Can you see the slide entitled Treatment Emergent Adverse Events NS Yes we can see that MSL Perfect antibody drug conjugates tend to be well tolerated because they deliver the cytotoxic payload into the tumour cell meaning that very little goes into the healthy tissue however like any treatment there are side effects What this slide shows you is the incidence of each of the reported adverse events is there anything particular that stands out for you NS Emmmm It actually looks like its generally well tolerated Im quite surprised Are there any particular things we need to consider to mitigate the risks MSL Not particularly just the usual supportive treatments you would use for patients with this stage cancer NS Ok great thank you MSL Is there anything else you would like me to show you in terms of the data Dr No I think we have enough there to be going on with MSL Great so in terms of next steps how do you plan to take this forward as a team Dr I think we will discuss it again at the MDT I also need to catch up with Dr Williamson to discuss the pathology set up MSL What additional information or support do you need from me Dr I think it would be good if you could send me the slides you have shown us today so I can reference them when discussing with ym colleagues MSL Of course would you be interested in signing up to our Clinical Paper Portal which would give you access to all the clinical studies for Avant Dr That sounds helpful what would I need to do MSL If youre happy for me to pass your email address on to my colleague in our Medical Information department they will create you an account and send you the link Dr Yes that would be great thank you MSL I also note from the registrations that you have signed up to our upcoming webinar The Evolution of Treatments for Advanced Lung Cancer Sally Julie would you like me to send you the information on the webinar JDr Yes please that would be

efficacy of Avant in combination with Docetaxel as second line therapy in patients with advanced or locally advanced NSCLC following first line treatment with platinumbased chemotherapy The primary outcomes measured were progression free survival and overall survival and the secondary outcome measured was change in patient reported outcomes Can you tell me what the title of the slide is that you can see on the screen Dr InclusionExclusion Criteria MSL Great well as you can see these were in the inclusion and exclusion criteria as you can see patients in the study had all progressed after 6 cycles of platinumbased chemotherapy There were 602 patients in the study randomised to one of two arms Any patients who had received any other systemic treatment for their cancer other than the platinumbased chemo were excluded from the study The results are now showing on the screen and were as follows: Objective response rate 45 vs 21 progression free survival 63 months vs 21 months and overall survival of 121 months vs 96 months You can see on the graph here the separation of the curves and a hazard ratio of 07 In terms of the patient recorded outcomes when looking at cough chest pain fatigue and loss of appetite Participants reported on average a 25 improvement in symptom scores across all measures What stands out for you in that data Dr Its certainly encouraging outcomes NS Im pleased to see the improvement in symptom scores for these patients quality of life is so important MSL Absolutely its important that we look at the impact on patients lives as well as the efficacy of the treatment Dr Could you just remind of the dosing again MSL Certainly let me just pull the dosing slide up for you can you see that The dose is weight dependent and is an infusion but the treatment schedule is as follows: Avant Docetaxel every 3 weeks or Placebo Docetaxel every 3 weeks Dr So you say its weight based whats the calculation MSL Its 02mgkg Dr And how often is that given MSL Its given on Day 1 of each 3weekly cycle alongside Docetaxel Dr Sally can you make a note of that for the nurses on the chemo suite NS Yes no problem at all Do you have the Adverse Events information you can show MSL Yes of course let me just pull the slide up Can you see the slide entitled Treatment Emergent Adverse Events NS Yes we can see that MSL Perfect antibody drug conjugates tend to be well tolerated because they deliver the cytotoxic payload into the tumour cell meaning that very little goes into the healthy tissue however like any treatment there are side effects What this slide shows you is the incidence of each of the reported adverse events is there anything particular that stands out for you NS Emmmm It actually looks like its generally well tolerated Im quite surprised Are there any particular things we need to consider to mitigate the risks MSL Not particularly just the usual supportive treatments you would use for patients with this stage cancer NS Ok great thank you MSL Is there anything else you would like me to show you in terms of the data Dr No I think we have enough there to be going on with MSL Great so in terms of next steps how do you plan to take this forward as a team Dr I think we will discuss it again at the MDT I also need to catch up with Dr Williamson to discuss the pathology set up MSL What additional information or support do you need from me Dr I think it would be good if you could send me the slides you have shown us today so I can reference them when discussing with ym colleagues MSL Of course would you be interested in signing up to our Clinical Paper Portal which would give you access to all the clinical studies for Avant Dr That sounds helpful what would I need to do MSL If youre happy for me to pass your email address on to my colleague in our Medical Information department they will create you an account and send you the link Dr Yes that would be great thank you MSL I also note from the registrations that you have signed up to our upcoming webinar The Evolution of Treatments for Advanced Lung Cancer Sally Julie would you like me to send you the information on the webinar JDr Yes please that would be interesting NS Sure Ill take a look MSL Dr Lewis the webinar will focus on some case studies that are developing is this something you might be interested in being involved in Dr I might be Id need to know a bit more MSL Would it be ok to reach out to you after the webinar to discuss in more depth Dr Yes that would be fine MSL Ok well Im conscious of time I will send out the webinar information and

of the presentation I will have provided you with the information you need to support your treatment decisions for your patients I am keen to answer any questions you may have so do please ask questions as we go through the data Dr Great thanks MSL Did any of you get the opportunity to attend the virtual ASCO meeting last month Dr Yes I did it was a really great meeting MSL Fantastic I got to attend several of the sessions myself and was really impressed with the data and advancements in patient care that I saw Dr Yes I really enjoy ASCO as there is always so much great content MSL What presentation stood out for you Dr So many of them to be honest but the ones I found most interesting were the ones with the new biomarkers its incredible how much we are discovering now in terms of targets for treatment and indicators for disease MSL I know its incredible and so promising for patients and clinicians alike Did you attend any of the presentations about Avant or ELC testing Dr Yes you couldnt really miss it there seemed to be a lot of studies being presented on both the drug and the testing MSL Yeah theres a significant level of interest in exploring what both the treatment and the test can offer lung cancer patients who have advanced disease as you know these patients can be very challenging to manage Can I ask what you remember from the presentations you observed Dr Of course I know that your phase 3 study showed an improvement in progression free survival as well as overall survival and I understand that the particular protein the drug targets sorry I cant remember the name of the protein but the protein is present in over 50 of patients is that correct MSL Fantastic it sounds like you have a good handle on the key elements can I just ask your colleagues how much they know about Avant Julie Sally JDr I have to admit I know very little about this treatment so I am looking forward to learning from you NS I have heard bits and bobs and I know as a team we are looking to start testing so it would be helpful to know a bit more MSL Ok great well if this works for you I propose that I take you through the data and the testing set up and then we can leave some time for any questions you may have should take about 15 minutes does that sound ok Dr Perfect thank you MSL Can I ask what discussions you have had to date with the other consultants about it Dr Well after ASCO I brought it up at a recent MDT meeting we had MSL Was that in relation to a specific patient you were discussing Dr No not really MSL Ok just a general conversation about treatment options Dr NODS Yeah pretty much MSL In terms of the testing element what information are you looking for specifically Dr SCRATCHES HEADTHINKS Best method of testing for the protein and the sensitivity of the test are both important to know MSL NODS Ok I have a few slides on that here As you may be aware its a simple immunohistochemistry test you just need access to the antibody Dr SITS FORWARD Where do we get the antibody from MSL You can order it direct from the company Dr Do we need a special testing kit MSL You can purchase an ELC readytouse assay I have a leaflet I can leave on that showing the details Dr Will the pathologists understand all of this MSL Yes they should be very familiar with these types of tests Dr Ok so what are the tissue requirements to be able to perform the test MSL Thats a good question As you know tissue is difficult to get in lung cancer cases and the requirements in terms of size of sample is not that high it is more important that the sample contains as many cancer cells as possible Dr So any sample is better than nothing in terms of size MSL I think in the discovery phase as you build your experience it would make sense to test as many samples as possible It might be worth speaking to your pathologists to check but I would imagine their expectations in terms of tissue sample would be similar across the board Dr Well I suppose so I guess we always try to get a good sample MSL In terms of the cut offs they looked at whether a sample contained 25 50 or 75 positive tumour cells and it was deemed that the ELC expression was high if the sample contained greater than 50 of cells expressing the protein Which means that if 50 or more of the cancer cells in the sample expresses the protein then the drug should work Dr Does that mean we would only use Avant in those patients who have 50 or greater expression MSL Yes thats correct Dr What percentage of patients would you expect to have 50 ELC expression in their tumours MSL The current data which I am showing on the screen which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Professor Sykes in 2018 suggests up to 65 of advanced or locally advanced nonsmall cell tumours may have some expression of ELC the level of expression within the individuals is not yet known which is why everyone who could be eligible for treatment should be tested Dr Ok I see Do you need to rebiopsy when they progress MSL The data supports use of either material from the initial biopsy or from a second biopsy following progression as its difficult to get tissue for the initial diagnosis I imagine it must be even harder the second time round Do you rebiopsy many patients at progression Dr We do if we can just in case the cancer has mutated but its not always possible MSL Yes we hear from a lot of clinicians that getting access to good tissue samples is particularly challenging Dr It can be we do a lot of EBUS at this hospital are cytology samples ok to use MSL If they can be formalin fixed into a block and sliced then yes Dr Ok I think thats what they do with them maybe another one for me to check with the pathologists MAKES A NOTE MSL If you would like me to support with any of the information you want to discuss with the pathologists then please let me know Dr Yes I might need some support will see how I get on first MSL Ok so thats it in terms of the test is there any other information you would like to know on that matter Dr I dont think so sounds like I need to speak to the pathologists first MSL No problem and as I said I can support with any information if you need me to NS We have a meeting with Dr Williamson the pathologist at the end of the week would you like me to add it to the agenda Dr Yes please Sally that would be great Dr Are you able to send me those slides you have MSL These ones on the detail around the testing requirements Dr Yes then I could forward them on to Dr Williamson MSL Yes thats no problem at all I can do that Dr Thanks MSL When you have introduced a new diagnostic test previously what process did you follow to ensure it was integrated with minimal disruption to the turn around times of results Dr To be honest the pathologists do most of that we just let them know which patients need testing when we have the MDT meeting MSL Ok I see whilst I understand that the pathologists take the lead on it is there anything that you would improve about the process you currently have for identifying which patients require which diagnostic test Dr To be honest it works pretty well I do think we should be quicker at adopting new tests though MSL Is there anything specific you think that could be done LEANS FORWARD Dr Probably not a lot of it comes down to funding within the trust and getting things through approval MSL That is similar in every trust to be honest Dr Yes I think it is a standard issue NODS IN AGREEMENT MSL Shall we have a look at the data now Dr Yes please MSL Is there anything particular any of you would like me to focus on Dr An overview of the phase 3 trial would be useful for me NS Id be keen to understand what side effects we are likely to see and how to manage them

the test MSL Thats a good question As you know tissue is difficult to get in lung cancer cases and the requirements in terms of size of sample is not that high it is more important that the sample contains as many cancer cells as possible Dr So any sample is better than nothing in terms of size MSL I think in the discovery phase as you build your experience it would make sense to test as many samples as possible It might be worth speaking to your pathologists to check but I would imagine their expectations in terms of tissue sample would be similar across the board Dr Well I suppose so I guess we always try to get a good sample MSL In terms of the cut offs they looked at whether a sample contained 25 50 or 75 positive tumour cells and it was deemed that the ELC expression was high if the sample contained greater than 50 of cells expressing the protein Which means that if 50 or more of the cancer cells in the sample expresses the protein then the drug should work Dr Does that mean we would only use Avant in those patients who have 50 or greater expression MSL Yes thats correct Dr What percentage of patients would you expect to have 50 ELC expression in their tumours MSL The current data which I am showing on the screen which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Professor Sykes in 2018 suggests up to 65 of advanced or locally advanced nonsmall cell tumours may have some expression of ELC the level of expression within the individuals is not yet known which is why everyone who could be eligible for treatment should be tested Dr Ok I see Do you need to rebiopsy when they progress MSL The data supports use of either material from the initial biopsy or from a second biopsy following progression as its difficult to get tissue for the initial diagnosis I imagine it must be even harder the second time round Do you rebiopsy many patients at progression Dr We do if we can just in case the cancer has mutated but its not always possible MSL Yes we hear from a lot of clinicians that getting access to good tissue samples is particularly challenging Dr It can be we do a lot of EBUS at this hospital are cytology samples ok to use MSL If they can be formalin fixed into a block and sliced then yes Dr Ok I think thats what they do with them maybe another one for me to check with the pathologists MAKES A NOTE MSL If you would like me to support with any of the information you want to discuss with the pathologists then please let me know Dr Yes I might need some support will see how I get on first MSL Ok so thats it in terms of the test is there any other information you would like to know on that matter Dr I dont think so sounds like I need to speak to the pathologists first MSL No problem and as I said I can support with any information if you need me to NS We have a meeting with Dr Williamson the pathologist at the end of the week would you like me to add it to the agenda Dr Yes please Sally that would be great Dr Are you able to send me those slides you have MSL These ones on the detail around the testing requirements Dr Yes then I could forward them on to Dr Williamson MSL Yes thats no problem at all I can do that Dr Thanks MSL When you have introduced a new diagnostic test previously what process did you follow to ensure it was integrated with minimal disruption to the turn around times of results Dr To be honest the pathologists do most of that we just let them know which patients need testing when we have the MDT meeting MSL Ok I see whilst I understand that the pathologists take the lead on it is there anything that you would improve about the process you currently have for identifying which patients require which diagnostic test Dr To be honest it works pretty well I do think we should be quicker at adopting new tests though MSL Is there anything specific you think that could be done LEANS FORWARD Dr Probably not a lot of it comes down to funding within the trust and getting things through approval MSL That is similar in every trust to be honest Dr Yes I think it is a standard issue NODS IN AGREEMENT MSL Shall we have a look at the data now Dr Yes please MSL Is there anything particular any of you would like me to focus on Dr An overview of the phase 3 trial would be useful for me NS Id be keen to understand what side effects we are likely to see and how to manage them please MSL Of course we can certainly cover that Can everyone see the title slide with the study name on it DrJDrNS Yes all together MSL The phase 3 study was a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled multinational and multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of Avant in combination with Docetaxel as second line therapy in patients with advanced or locally advanced NSCLC following first line treatment with platinumbased chemotherapy The primary outcomes measured were progression free survival and overall survival and the secondary outcome measured was change in patient reported outcomes Can you tell me what the title of the slide is that you can see on the screen Dr InclusionExclusion Criteria MSL Great well as you can see these were in the inclusion and exclusion criteria as you can see patients in the study had all progressed after 6 cycles of platinumbased chemotherapy There were 602 patients in the study randomised to one of two arms Any patients who had received any other systemic treatment for their cancer other than the platinumbased chemo were excluded from the study The results are now showing on the screen and were as follows: Objective response rate 45 vs 21 progression free survival 63 months vs 21 months and overall survival of 121 months vs 96 months You can see on the graph here the separation of the curves and a hazard ratio of 07 In terms of the patient recorded outcomes when looking at cough chest pain fatigue and loss of appetite Participants reported on average a 25 improvement in symptom scores across all measures What stands out for you in that data Dr Its certainly encouraging outcomes NS Im pleased to see the improvement in symptom scores for these patients quality of life is so important MSL Absolutely its important that we look at the impact on patients lives as well as the efficacy of the treatment Dr Could you just remind of the dosing again MSL Certainly let me just pull the dosing slide up for you can you see that The dose is weight dependent and is an infusion but the treatment schedule is as follows: Avant Docetaxel every 3 weeks or Placebo Docetaxel every 3 weeks Dr So you say its weight based whats the calculation MSL Its 02mgkg Dr And how often is that given MSL Its given on Day 1 of each 3weekly cycle alongside Docetaxel Dr Sally can you make a note of that for the nurses on the chemo suite NS Yes no problem at all Do you have the Adverse Events information you can show MSL Yes of course let me just pull the slide up Can you see the slide entitled Treatment Emergent Adverse Events NS Yes we can see that MSL Perfect antibody drug conjugates tend to be well tolerated because they deliver the cytotoxic payload into the tumour cell meaning that very little goes into the healthy tissue however like any treatment there are side effects What this slide shows you is the incidence of each of the reported adverse events is there anything particular that stands out for you NS Emmmm It actually looks like its generally well tolerated Im quite surprised Are there any particular things we need to consider to mitigate the risks MSL Not particularly just the usual supportive treatments you would use for patients with this stage cancer NS Ok great thank you MSL Is there anything else you would like me to show you in terms of the data Dr No I think we have enough there to be going on with MSL Great so in terms of next steps how do you plan to take this forward as a team Dr I think we will discuss it again at the MDT I also need to catch up with Dr Williamson to discuss the pathology set up MSL What additional information or support do you need from me Dr I think it would be good if you could send me the slides you have shown us today so I can reference them when discussing with ym colleagues MSL Of course would you be interested in signing up to our Clinical Paper Portal which would give you access to all the clinical studies for Avant Dr That sounds helpful what would I need to do MSL If youre happy for me to pass your email address on to my colleague in our Medical Information department they will create you an account and send you the link Dr Yes that would be great thank you MSL I also note from the registrations that you have signed up to our upcoming webinar The Evolution of Treatments for Advanced Lung Cancer Sally Julie would you like me to send you the information on the webinar JDr Yes please that would be interesting NS Sure Ill take a look MSL Dr Lewis the webinar will focus on some case studies that are developing is this something you might be interested in being involved in Dr I might be Id need to know a bit more MSL Would it be ok to reach out to you after the webinar to discuss in more depth Dr Yes that would be fine MSL Ok well Im conscious of time I will send out the webinar information and get Dr Lewis set up on the clinical paper portal I know you have plans to speak to your pathologist and the wider team please do

Great thank you Let me introduce myself Im Laurence from Pharmapro and I am here in response to a medical request you made through my colleague Louise I would like to take you through the data regarding Avant which is licensed in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced or locally advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer that have progressed following first line treatment with

with the information you need to support your treatment decisions for your patients I am keen to answer any questions you may have so do please ask questions as we go through the data Dr Great thanks MSL Did any of you get the opportunity to attend the virtual ASCO meeting last month Dr Yes I did it was a really great meeting MSL Fantastic I got to attend several of the sessions myself and was really impressed with the data and advancements in patient care that I saw Dr Yes I really enjoy ASCO as there is always so much great content MSL What presentation stood out for you Dr So many of them to be honest but the ones I found most interesting were the ones with the new biomarkers its incredible how much we are discovering now in terms of targets for treatment and indicators for disease MSL I know its incredible and so promising for patients and clinicians alike Did you attend any of the presentations about Avant or ELC testing Dr Yes you couldnt really miss it there seemed to be a lot of studies being presented on both the drug and the testing MSL Yeah theres a significant level of interest in exploring what both the treatment and the test can offer lung cancer patients who have advanced disease as you know these patients can be very challenging to manage Can I ask what you remember from the presentations you observed Dr Of course I know that your phase 3 study showed an improvement in progression free survival as well as overall survival and I understand that the particular protein the drug targets sorry I cant remember the name of the protein but the protein is present in over 50 of patients is that correct MSL Fantastic it sounds like you have a good handle on the key elements can I just ask your colleagues how much they know about Avant Julie Sally JDr I have to admit I know very little about this treatment so I am looking forward to learning from you NS I have heard bits and bobs and I know as a team we are looking to start testing so it would be helpful to know a bit more MSL Ok great well if this works for you I propose that I take you through the data and the testing set up and then we can leave some time for any questions you may have should take about 15 minutes does that sound ok Dr Perfect thank you MSL Can I ask what discussions you have had to date with the other consultants about it Dr Well after ASCO I brought it up at a recent MDT meeting we had MSL Was that in relation to a specific patient you were discussing Dr No not really MSL Ok just a general conversation about treatment options Dr NODS Yeah pretty much MSL In terms of the testing element what information are you looking for specifically Dr SCRATCHES HEADTHINKS Best method of testing for the protein and the sensitivity of the test are both important to

see me ok WAVES Dr Hello yes I can WAVES BACK MSL Can I just check who else we have in the meeting please DR Yes of course does everyone want to introduce themselves JDr Hi Im Julie one of the junior doctors working alongside Dr Lewis at the moment MSL Great to meet you Julie can I ask what stage youre at in your training JDr Sure Im an F2 so still pretty early on MSL Well its great to meet you thanks for joining the meeting NS Hi Im Sally the Lung Specialist Nurse MSL Brilliant lovely to meet you Sally Thanks for introducing yourselves are we expecting anyone else DR I dont think so MSL Great thank you Let me introduce myself Im Laurence from Pharmapro and I am here in response to a medical request you made through my colleague Louise I would like to take you through the data regarding Avant which is licensed in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced or locally advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer that have progressed following first line treatment with platinum chemotherapy Is that what you were expecting this meeting to be about DR Yes thats what I was hoping for MSL Excellent my aim is that by the end of the presentation I will have provided you with the information you need to support your treatment decisions for your patients I am keen to answer any questions you may have so do please ask questions as we go through the data Dr Great thanks MSL Did any of you get the opportunity to attend the virtual ASCO meeting last month Dr Yes I did it was a really great meeting MSL Fantastic I got to attend several of the sessions myself and was really impressed with the data and advancements in patient care that I saw Dr Yes I really enjoy ASCO as there is always so much great content MSL What presentation stood out for you Dr So many of them to be honest but the ones I found most interesting were the ones with the new biomarkers its incredible how much we are discovering now in terms of targets for treatment and indicators for disease MSL I know its incredible and so promising for patients and clinicians alike Did you attend any of the presentations about Avant or ELC testing Dr Yes you couldnt really miss it there seemed to be a lot of studies being presented on both the drug and the testing MSL Yeah theres a significant level of interest in exploring what both the treatment and the test can offer lung cancer patients who have advanced disease as you know these patients can be very challenging to manage Can I ask what you remember from the presentations you observed Dr Of course I know that your phase 3 study showed an improvement in progression free survival as well as overall survival and I understand that the particular protein the drug targets sorry I cant remember the name of the protein but the protein is present in over 50 of patients is that correct MSL Fantastic it sounds like you have a good handle on the key elements can I just ask your colleagues how much they know about Avant Julie Sally JDr I have to admit I know very little about this treatment so I am looking forward to learning from you NS I have heard bits and bobs and I know as a team we are looking to start testing so it would be helpful to know a bit more MSL Ok great well if this works for you I propose that I take you through the data and the testing set up and then we can leave some time for any questions you may have should take about 15 minutes does that sound ok Dr Perfect thank you MSL Can I ask what discussions you have had to date with the other consultants about it Dr Well after ASCO I brought it up at a recent MDT meeting we had MSL Was that in relation to a specific patient you were discussing Dr No not really MSL Ok just a general conversation about treatment options Dr NODS Yeah pretty much MSL In terms of the testing element what information are you looking for specifically Dr SCRATCHES HEADTHINKS Best method of testing for the protein and the sensitivity of the test are both important to know MSL NODS Ok I have a few slides on that here As you may be aware its a simple immunohistochemistry test you just need access to the antibody Dr SITS FORWARD Where do we get the antibody from MSL You can order it direct from the company Dr Do we need a special testing kit MSL You can purchase an ELC readytouse assay I have a leaflet I can leave on that showing the details Dr Will the pathologists understand all of this MSL Yes they should be very familiar with these types of tests Dr Ok so what are the tissue requirements to be able to perform the test MSL Thats a good question As you know tissue is difficult to get in lung cancer cases and the requirements in terms of size of sample is not that high it is more important that the sample contains as many cancer cells as possible Dr So any sample is better than nothing in terms of size MSL I think in the discovery phase as you build your experience it would make sense to test as many samples as possible It might be worth speaking to your pathologists to check but I would imagine their expectations in terms of tissue sample would be similar across the board Dr Well I suppose so I guess we always try to get a good sample MSL In terms of the cut offs they looked at whether a sample contained 25 50 or 75 positive tumour cells and it was deemed that the ELC expression was high if the sample contained greater than 50 of cells expressing the protein Which means that if 50 or more of the cancer cells in the sample expresses the protein then the drug should work Dr Does that mean we would only use Avant in those patients who have 50 or greater expression MSL Yes thats correct Dr What percentage of patients would you expect to have 50 ELC expression in their tumours MSL The current data which I am showing on the screen which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Professor Sykes in 2018 suggests up to 65 of advanced or locally advanced nonsmall cell tumours may have some expression of ELC the level of expression within the individuals is not yet known which is why everyone who could be eligible for treatment should be tested Dr Ok I see Do you need to rebiopsy when they progress MSL The data supports use of either material from the initial biopsy or from a second biopsy following progression as its difficult to get tissue for the initial diagnosis I imagine it must be even harder the second time round Do you rebiopsy many patients at progression Dr We do if we can just in case the cancer has mutated but its not always possible MSL Yes we hear from a lot of clinicians that getting access to good tissue samples is particularly challenging Dr It can be we do a lot of EBUS at this hospital are cytology samples ok to use MSL If they can be formalin fixed into a block and sliced then yes Dr Ok I think thats what they do with them maybe another one for me to check with the pathologists MAKES A NOTE MSL If you would like me to support with any of the information you want to discuss with the pathologists then please let me know Dr Yes I might need some support will see how I get on first MSL Ok so thats it in terms of the test is there any other information you would like to know on that matter Dr I dont think so sounds like I need to speak to the pathologists first MSL No problem and as I said I can support with any information if you need me to NS We have a meeting with Dr Williamson the pathologist at the end of the week would you like me to add it to the agenda Dr Yes please Sally that would be great Dr Are you able to send me those slides you have MSL These ones on the detail around the testing requirements Dr Yes then I could forward them on to Dr Williamson MSL Yes thats no problem at all I can do that Dr Thanks MSL When you have introduced a new diagnostic test previously what process did you follow to ensure it was integrated with minimal disruption to the turn around times of results Dr To be honest the pathologists do most of that we just let them know which patients need testing when we have the MDT meeting MSL Ok I see whilst I understand that the pathologists take the lead on it is there anything that you would improve about the process you currently have for identifying which patients require which diagnostic test Dr To be honest it works pretty well I do think we should be quicker at adopting new tests though MSL Is there anything specific you think that could be done LEANS FORWARD Dr Probably not a lot of it comes down to funding within the trust and getting things through approval MSL That is similar in every trust to be honest Dr Yes I think it is a standard issue NODS IN AGREEMENT MSL Shall we have a look at the data now Dr Yes please MSL Is there anything particular any of you would like me to focus on Dr An overview of the phase 3 trial would be useful for me NS Id be keen to understand what side effects we are likely to see and how to manage them please MSL Of course we can certainly cover that Can everyone see the title slide with the study name on it DrJDrNS Yes all together MSL The phase 3 study was a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled multinational and multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of Avant in combination with Docetaxel as second line therapy in patients with advanced or locally advanced NSCLC following first line treatment with platinumbased chemotherapy The primary outcomes measured were progression free survival and overall survival and the secondary outcome measured was change in patient reported outcomes Can you tell me what the title of the slide is that you can see on the screen Dr InclusionExclusion Criteria MSL Great well as you can see these were in the inclusion and exclusion criteria as you can see patients in the study had all progressed after 6 cycles of platinumbased chemotherapy There were 602 patients in the study randomised to one of two arms Any patients who had received any other systemic treatment for their cancer other than the platinumbased chemo were excluded from the study The results are now showing on the screen and were as follows: Objective response rate 45 vs 21 progression free survival 63 months vs 21 months and overall survival of 121 months vs 96 months You can see on the graph here the separation of the curves and a hazard ratio of 07 In terms of the patient recorded outcomes when looking at cough chest pain fatigue and loss of appetite Participants reported on average a 25 improvement in symptom scores across all measures What stands out for you in that data Dr Its certainly encouraging outcomes NS Im pleased to see the improvement in symptom scores for these patients quality of life is so important MSL Absolutely its important that we look at the impact on patients lives as well as the efficacy of the treatment Dr Could you just remind of the dosing again MSL Certainly let me just pull the dosing slide up for you can you see that The dose is weight dependent and is an infusion but the treatment schedule is as follows: Avant Docetaxel every 3 weeks or Placebo Docetaxel every 3 weeks Dr So you say its weight based whats the calculation MSL Its 02mgkg Dr And how often is that given MSL Its given on Day 1 of each 3weekly cycle alongside Docetaxel Dr Sally can you make a note of that for the nurses on the chemo suite NS Yes no problem at all Do you have the Adverse Events information you can show MSL Yes of course let me just pull the slide up Can you see the slide entitled Treatment Emergent Adverse Events NS Yes we can see that MSL Perfect antibody drug conjugates tend to be well tolerated because they deliver the cytotoxic payload into the tumour cell meaning that very little goes into the healthy tissue however like any treatment there are side effects What this slide shows you is the incidence of each of the reported adverse events is there anything particular that stands out for you NS Emmmm It actually looks like its generally well tolerated Im quite surprised Are there any particular things we need to consider to mitigate the risks MSL Not particularly just the usual supportive treatments you would use for patients with this stage cancer NS Ok great thank you MSL Is there anything else you would like me to show you in terms of the data Dr No I think we have enough there to be going on with MSL Great so in terms of next steps how do you plan to take this forward as a team Dr I think we will discuss it again at the MDT I also need to catch up with Dr Williamson to discuss the pathology set up MSL What additional information or support do you need from me Dr I think it would be good if you could send me the slides you have shown us today so I can reference them when discussing with ym colleagues MSL Of course would you be interested in signing up to our Clinical Paper Portal which would give you access to all the clinical studies for Avant Dr That sounds helpful what would I need to do MSL If youre happy for me to pass your email address on to my colleague in our Medical Information department they will create you an account and send you the link Dr Yes that would be great thank you MSL I also note from the registrations that you have signed up to our upcoming webinar The Evolution of Treatments for Advanced Lung Cancer Sally Julie would you like me to send you the information on the webinar JDr Yes please that would be interesting NS Sure Ill take a look MSL Dr Lewis the webinar will focus on some case studies that are developing is this something you might be interested in being involved in Dr I might be Id need to know a bit more MSL Would it be ok to reach out to you after the webinar to discuss in more depth Dr Yes that would be fine MSL Ok well Im conscious of time I will send out the webinar information and get Dr Lewis set up on the clinical paper portal I know you have plans to speak to your pathologist and the wider team please do let me know if you need any support with that Dr Will do many thanks

Zeit Es geht um das Lipidmanagement Ihrer KHKPatienten Frau Doktor wie entscheiden Sie denn welche Therapieoption wann eingesetzt wird fr die LDLCSenkung Speaker 0 00:00:20 Also ich fange an standardmig mit dem Statin dann eskaliere ich mit EZTMIP Wenn das noch nicht ausreicht kommt die Bempiduinsure Und wenn das immer noch nicht ausreicht dann kommt ein PCSK9Hemmer Und Speaker 1 00:00:36 Frau Doktor die Bempiduinsure wenden Sie dann auch schon direkt an Wie ist da dann die LDLCWertsenkung Erreichen Sie immer den LDL den Zielwert Speaker 0 00:00:50 Naja immer nicht Speaker 1 00:00:51 Ach so ja Speaker 0 00:00:54 Genau und dann ist halt die nchste Instanz der PCSK9 Manchmal werden ja auch die Statinen nicht vertragen dann reicht eine Bempiduinsure ohnehin als Monoprparat in der Regel nicht aus Oder in Kombination mit EZTMIP Also ja je nachdem wie die Situation ist Aber so ist sozusagen meine Kaskade Speaker 1 00:01:15 Aha super Und speziell auch die KHKPatienten da haben Sie nochmal so ein Auge drauf wie das bei den Werten ist mit der Senkung Ja ich besorge Speaker 0 00:01:29 Bei denen Das Speaker 1 00:01:31 Ist Speaker 0 00:01:31 Ja unsere Hauptklientel was die LDLSenkung anbelangt Ja Speaker 1 00:01:36 Und Frau Doktor haben Sie festgestellt dass durch so eine frhzeitige Einstellung auf die Bempiduinsure die Ergebnisse besser sind Oder haben Sie da jetzt nichts Besonderes feststellen knnen Speaker 0 00:01:53 Also ich habe nicht jetzt massenhaft Patienten die die Bempiduinsure bekommen Aber hufig wenn sie sie kriegen ist das manchmal sozusagen der

way of life these days isnt it HCP It certainly is HCPP Well thank you for taking the time to speak with me today I know we discussed GABODERM last time we met and we covered some of the basics but I really believe its an outstanding drug that could be life changing for the right patients Could we revisit your adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis please Id love you to have the confidence to want to try GABODERM in one of these patients if that is okay with you HCP Yes of course HCPP Last time we met you mentioned that you were one of the first to try secretamab and it had become one of your routine treatments for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis HCP Yes thats right HCPP Could you tell me what was it that triggered you to try it for the first time and what did you see that made you decide to make it one of your mainstay treatments HCP Well let me think I seem to remember it was one of the first new treatments we had for plaque psoriasis for years and wed not really had anything that effective We had to try a whole gamut of treatments in combination to achieve any kind of significant improvement for patients emollients steroids UV So when I saw the data for secretamab it was outstanding and compared to what wed experienced before I just had to try it From there it lived up to my kind of reserved expectations and I was truly amazed Its been a mainstay ever since HCPP Thank you for sharing that There have been other new products launched in this area since but you dont seem to have adopted any of those what would a new treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis have to demonstrate for you to have that I must try it moment again HCP It really has to offer something significant in terms of efficacy Clear space between it and secretamab HCPP And when you say efficacy what would that be for you PASI 90 speed what exactly for you HCP With secretamab it was initially PASI 90 it was just so far out ahead of what we had at the time Otherwise the things Im looking for are initial speed of action and sustained effectiveness I dont want it waring off in other words HCPP Okay so if I want you to have that I must try it moment again I need to demonstrate efficacy PASI 90 and if possible significant improvements over current treatment Speed of action and that it will not ware off over time Is that correct HCP Yes if you can do that Ill be impressed HCPP Okay I think I can let me show you the RADIANT Study Now although this is a UCB sponsored study it was peer reviewed and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2021 It was a head to head doubleblind randomised study of 743 moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients compared to secretamab which you have been routinely using It this okay to present HCP Yes its not very often we get new drugs compared to something we routinely use so yes Im very interested to see what it says HCPP Well here the Yaxis shows the percentage of patients achieving PASI 90 and the Xaxis shows the number of weeks of treatment What you can see is that GABODERM moves ahead of secretamab quite early and by week 4 349 of patients have achieved PASI 90 compared to just 175 of the secretamab group Any comments yet HCP Not yet please carry on HCPP The separation is maintained and significant the PValue was less than zero point zero zero one So achieves really good PASI 90 and has significant superiority to secretamab the speed of action shows separation early and is significant at week 4 and the efficacy is maintained over time as you can see No waring off Also as you can see a high percentage of patients respond excellently to GABODERM What do you think now HCP I think I think I probably should try it HCPP Thatd be great HCP So it does raise a few questions how do I prescribe and administer GABODERM and is there anything I need to be aware of You know side effects etc HCPP So ideally wed suggest using it in a biologic nave patient so you can see just how good it is and HCP Im not sure Id use it for the first time in a biologic nave patient but I do have a couple in mind whove been struggling on their current biologics HCPP Okay thats great So how to prescribe and administer HCPP Its an initial 5 doses similar to other biologics and then switching to an 8 week interval for maintenance Overall its eight less than secretamab in the first year and less on an ongoing basis which patients will love HCP Well thats easy HCPP It comes in a handy autoinjector so patients can do this themselves at home once youve trained them HCP Excellent and side effects HCPP Similar to the others apart from you may see candidiasis in up to 1 in 8 patients but its transient and can be treated with a simple antifungal In the studies we saw very few people stop treatment due to this HCP Okay that all seems very straight forward HCPP Do you have a patient in mind and how will you ensure they receive GABODERM HCP I do have someone in mind but I know theyre not due in for a couple of weeks Also although Ill see the patient itll be the nurse that administers the first dose and has responsibility for training the patient HCPP Well could we book a meeting for you to meet the nurse and ensure she has everything she needs to start that patient on GABODERM HCP Yes lets do that HCPP Excellent also its important for you to see how well GABODERM works if its going to become one of your routine treatments Could we book another meeting a couple of weeks after the patient commences treatment so we can check the patients progress I really want you to see how fast GABODERM works HCP DIARIES COMPLETED AND DATE AGREED Yes lets book that when you come in to see the nurse HCPP Excellent Ill see you then", "segments": "[\"HCP Morning Lukas Birgit Good to see

RE:Remind me Tracey I understand from Partridge Health that youre looking to repatriate your CCPs so I was hoping today if we could just chat about that a little bit and just ask you a few questions about that if thatd be okay HCP:Yes of course Yes RE:Great So before I go into that I just wanted to do a little bit more of a background to the lab So with your instrument setup at the moment what instruments do you have in immunology at the moment HCP:In immunology obviously weve got the Optimed 360 just the one of those RE:So with the CCPs Tracey whats your workload at the moment How many are you doing a day roughly HCP:A day Gosh I think current workload is about 250 a month that were sending away RE:And so youre sending them away to Partridge at the moment and what analyser do they run them on HCP:Theyre using the Biovance automated system so they just pop them on and theyre tracked and the turnaround times are really rapid which is fantastic RE:So in terms of bringing them back in house then in a perfect world how would you like to see the service setup for your CCPs here How would you like to run them do you think HCP:I think the main plan is because we also have automation downstairs there is the Biovance tracking system and therefore its a good crossover it minimises the comparison we need to do as were using that test already were kind of used to the results and inhouse all we have to do is a minor validation of the methods to see that were producing similar results RE:I see so turnaround times are key really for you HCP:Yes seven days for CCPs RE:Seven days currently okay So with the Optimed 360 at the moment are you running that every day HCP:Yes most days RE:And how often do you run the EliA IgG method HCP:Thats pretty much every day for a variety of tests RE:So what would you say then if we could look at say for example running your CCPs three times a day Because am I right in thinking that CCP testing its not classed as urgent per se HCP:No thats why its got quite a generous turnaround time compared to MPA PR3s and things like that RE:With it being continuous loading we could have the EliA IgG method set up every day and maybe you could prioritise three days but know that youve got the leeway and then you can feed the samples through every day and you would still be comfortably within your sevenday turnaround HCP:Sure One thing though whats the first time to result for those RE:I want to say its about an hour and a half but Im not entirely sure Funny you say that actually Ive got a brochure that talks about the process time and shows a schematic but I dont actually have any with me so sorry about that but I could maybe get one to you But that shows quite nicely the time to first result So still comfortably within your working day and working during the three days per week for CCPs you would be within your turnaround time HCP:Okay yes If you could forward that on thatd be really handy please RE:Yes So does that sounds like something that would work in terms of doing CCP three times a day do you think that would fit HCP:Yes I think at this stage depending on costs etc its worth thinking about definitely RE:And then what would be involved in that Tracey in terms of if you wanted to consider looking at them on the Optimed 360 HCP:Well obviously you know weve never got enough staff and theres never enough time is there any way you could give us some support with an evaluation Because if we were going to do a Biovance evaluation it would be minimal whereas if we were considering the 360 it would be a substantially larger study So RE:Yes Im sure we could sort something out for you thats no problem Leave that with me HCP:Okay thank you RE:So thats really great Ive got a good understanding of what youre looking to achieve So perhaps maybe the next step would be we could arrange another meeting and we can talk about it again in a little bit more detail Does that sound okay HCP:Yes absolutely RE:We can always come back HCP:Yes RE:Yes thatd be really helpful but thank you for today thats really useful to know where you are and what youre looking to achieve and yes we can come

would you need to see from me today to feel confident to prescribe Gaboderm in this group of patients GP :It would be great to see the efficacy data you have and that it has a favourable side effect profile versus adalimumab Rep:Ive heard a few of your colleagues mention the importance of efficacy for this group Theyve also said that the lack of efficacy sometimes leads to patients just giving up on finding anything that works GP:Yes youre absolutely right and we need to manage these patients a lot better than we do at the moment but historically we just havent had the range of treatments needed Rep :Okay well I hope Gaboderm can answer the efficacy and side effects questions for you Let me introduce you to the DERMAB STUDY it was published in the New England Journal of Medicine It was a 5year headtohead study with adalimumab Its randomised double blind with 287 patients The results showed equivalent efficacy with fewer side effects because it is topical rather than systemic What do you think GP :That sounds impressive Are any of my colleagues using it Rep:Yes 3 GPs from the Cross surgery down the road are already using it and Dr Ali from the hospital has been referring patients out to GPs in the area GP:Thats really reassuring to hear where was the study conducted again Rep :It was across the EU GP:Mmmmm ok thats impressive Rep:So today I hope Ive answered your questions regarding efficacy and side effects to help to manage your eczema patients Will you use Gaboderm for your next eczema patient GP :Yes I think I will Rep:Brilliant What are the next steps to ensure the next patient gets Gaboderm GP:I think that we need to get the nurse involved so that she can identify the patients when she sees them Rep:And whats the best way to get them involved GP:Ill speak to her right now let me give her a call Rep:Brilliant Thank you", "segments": "[\"Rep :Thank you for seeing me GP :Hello how are you Rep:Very well thank you and how are you GP:Much better since the last time I saw you Rep:Oh yes you were going on holiday werent you GP:Yes I was Rep:How was it GP It was great I feel well rested What have you got for me today Rep :Excellent well I havent spoken to you about this before but I want to show you some exciting information about Gaboderm ointment for your moderate to severe eczema patients These are patients who are having frequent flares so the chances are that youll be seeing them in the practice on a regular basis It would be great if you could identify one of these patients to use Gaboderm in and see how it reduces their flares for yourself Would

HCP:Yes really good thanks Rachael How are you Nice to see you RE:Im very well thank you Thank you for meeting with me today RE:Remind me Tracey I understand from Partridge Health that youre looking to repatriate your CCPs so I was hoping today if we could just chat about that a little bit and just ask you a few questions about that if thatd be okay HCP:Yes of course Yes RE:Great So before I go into that I just wanted to do a little bit more of a background to the lab So with your instrument setup at the moment what instruments do you have in immunology at the moment HCP:In immunology obviously weve got the Optimed 360 just the one of those RE:So with the CCPs Tracey whats your workload at the moment How many are you doing a day roughly HCP:A day Gosh I think current workload is about 250 a month that were sending away RE:And so youre sending them away to Partridge at the moment and what analyser do they run them on HCP:Theyre using the Biovance automated system so they just pop them on and theyre tracked and the turnaround times are really rapid which is fantastic RE:So in terms of bringing them back in house then in a perfect world how would you like to see the service setup for your CCPs here How would you like to run them do you think HCP:I think the main plan is because we also have automation downstairs there is the Biovance tracking system and therefore its a good crossover it minimises the comparison we need to do as were using that test already were kind of used to the results and inhouse all we have to do is a minor validation of the methods to see that were producing similar results RE:I see so turnaround times are key really for you HCP:Yes seven days for CCPs RE:Seven days currently okay So with the Optimed 360 at the moment are you running that every day HCP:Yes most days RE:And how often do you run the EliA IgG method HCP:Thats pretty much every day for a variety of tests RE:So what would you say then if we could look at say for example running your CCPs three times a day Because am I right in thinking that CCP testing its not classed as urgent per se HCP:No thats why its got quite a generous turnaround time compared to MPA PR3s and things like that RE:With it being continuous loading we could have the EliA IgG method set up every day and maybe you could prioritise three days but know that youve got the leeway and then you can feed the samples through every day and you would still be comfortably within your sevenday turnaround HCP:Sure One thing though whats the first time to result for those RE:I want to say its about an hour and a half but Im not entirely sure Funny you say that actually Ive got a brochure that talks about the process time and shows a schematic but I dont actually have any with me so sorry about that but I could maybe get one to you But that shows quite nicely the time to first result So still comfortably within your working day and working during the three days per week for CCPs you would be within your turnaround time HCP:Okay yes If you could forward that on thatd be really handy please RE:Yes So does that sounds like something that would work in terms of doing CCP three times a day do you think that would fit HCP:Yes I think at this stage depending on costs etc its worth thinking about definitely RE:And then what would be involved in that Tracey in terms of if you wanted to consider looking at them on the Optimed 360 HCP:Well obviously you know weve never got enough staff and theres never enough time is there any way you could give us some support with an evaluation Because if we were going to do a Biovance evaluation it would be minimal whereas if we were considering the 360 it would be a substantially larger study So RE:Yes Im sure we could sort something out for you thats no problem Leave that with me HCP:Okay thank you RE:So thats really great Ive got a good understanding of what youre looking to achieve So perhaps maybe the next step would be we could arrange another meeting and we can talk about it again in a little bit more detail Does that sound okay HCP:Yes absolutely RE:We can always come back HCP:Yes RE:Yes thatd be really helpful but thank you for today thats really useful to know where you are and what youre looking to achieve and yes we can come back and talk about it again HCP:Okay super RE:So thank you HCP:Yes lovely to see you

fr Ihre Zeit Frau Tattuschall Ich hatte mit der MFA abgesprochen dass ich ber die Bempiduinsure kurz spreche ber das Nustendi Ist das bei Ihnen in der Praxis spielt das eine groe Rolle oder eher auer der Reihe im Lipidmanagement Ich Speaker 2 00:00:28 Habe noch nicht die Gelegenheit gehabt das zu verordnen Speaker 1 00:00:33 Ah okay Wie Speaker 2 00:00:35 Es ist kann ich jetzt nicht sagen Speaker 1 00:00:38 Kommen Sie praktisch dann im Lipidmanagement zum LDLZielwertsenkung dann eigentlich ganz gut mit den Statinen und EZTMib zurecht Also Speaker 2 00:00:47 Mit dem Nilemdo da habe ich einen Patienten der damit luft weil da wirklich Fortschreiten Das ist eine angiosklerose bei einer therapieresistenten Hyperlipidemie Und der hat das jetzt noch dazu Speaker 1 00:01:10 Ah okay Ja super Speaker 2 00:01:15 Ist das jetzt nicht Ihr Prparat Speaker 1 00:01:18 Doch doch ist beides Nilemdo ist nur die Bempiduinsure Und die Nustendi ist praktisch die Bempiduinsure plus EZTMib Sodass man das dann einfach compliancefreudig dann zusammenfassen kann in einer Tablette Weil Nilemdo ist eigentlich eher so zum Testen weil es ja auch nur eine N1 gibt davon dass man da einfach nur mal testet ob das funktioniert kommt der in den Zielwertbereich wird es gut vertragen und so weiter So dass man dann im Zweifelsfall im zweiten Schritt einfach das Nustendi gibt und in einer Tablette mit EZTMib das kombinieren kann Knnen Speaker 2 00:02:04 Wir das nochmal bitte buchstabieren Das ist das No Speaker 1 00:02:09 No N N Nordpol Ulf Ulrike Siegfried Theodor Emil Nordpol Dora Ida Nustendi Speaker 2 00:02:28 Hab ich das falsch eingegeben Ich guck mal gerade nochmal Speaker 1 00:02:32 Genau das gibt es nmlich auch in der N3 Ne Speaker 2 00:02:37 Ja Speaker 1 00:02:38 Sodass man da praktisch dann eher in dieser Kombination dass man dann in dieser Kombination dass man dann in dieser Kombination dann eher in dieser Kombination dann in der Dauertherapie dann natrlich dann auch die N3 zur Verfgung hat So hatten wir das gedacht Speaker 2 00:02:48 Und Speaker 1 00:02:49 Das EZTMeb wird er bestimmt auch bekommen und dann hat man das einfach zusammenfassen Speaker 2 00:03:20 So Speaker 1 00:03:24 Hatten wir das dann einfach gedacht Ja Speaker 2 00:03:27 Das haben wir auch gedacht Ach das ist gut Ja das ist gut Ich mache mir gerade eine Notiz bei Ihnen Speaker 1 00:03:33 Ja super Dass wir dann beim nchsten Mal daran denken dass man das einfach zusammenfassen kann Und dann auch ist das natrlich dann auch wirtschaftlicher Speaker 2 00:03:44 Natrlich Speaker 1 00:03:46 Darum geht es ja auch immer bei Ihnen Speaker 2 00:03:50 Da hatte ich das gerade Ach er hat es gerade am 81 gerade geholt Aber er kommt so demnchst Speaker 1 00:03:58 Eben genau Speaker 2 00:04:01 Ja Ja super Speaker 1 00:04:02 Sehr schn Da freue ich mich dass ich Ihnen da kurz helfen konnte Denn unser Zielpatient ist ja doch dann der Hochrisikopatient mit koronarer Herzkrankheit und so weiter Speaker 2 00:04:13 Ja Und Speaker 1 00:04:15 Dass es einfach noch ein greres Benefit fr ihn ist kardiovaskulre Erkrankungen dann vorzubeugen Ja Zumindest zu minimieren Wollen wir so sagen Speaker 2 00:04:27 Ja Speaker 1 00:04:28 Ja Ja Ja Also der Therapiealgorithmus ist dann einfach um die Bempiduinsure des Nusdendi einzusetzen ist einfach dann indem man zwei Statine ausreizt das Ezedemib ausreizt und wenn dann das Ganze nicht noch nicht in ihr Zielwert ist dass man dann das NiLemDoNusdendi einsetzen kann bevor man diese teuren PCSK9 immer nimmt ne so Speaker 2 00:04:50 Gibt es denn da irgendwelche Formalitten die ich beachten muss bei der Verordnung Speaker 1 00:04:57 Ja Sie mssen mindestens zwei Statine ausgereizt haben und darunter auch das Arthorastatin also das Neueste Wenn das nicht funktioniert ist das dann ja dann Icetimib Speaker 2 00:05:16 Auch Speaker 1 00:05:18 Und wenn diese beiden Sachen dann im LDLZielwert noch nicht erreicht wurden und es ist ein Patient mit hohem oder sehr hohem Risiko knnen Sie dann die Bambytoinsure nehmen So ist der Algorithmus Ja Speaker 2 00:05:38 Gut Das ging schon los vor Jahren Ja Ja das ist interessant Speaker 1 00:05:49 Ich lerne immer was dazu bei welchen Patienten das eingesetzt wird und das ist immer spannend zu hren Speaker 2 00:05:57 Ja den habe ich schon ber 20 Jahre in meiner Behandlung und er hat immer extreme CholesterinWerte gehabt LDL Und das hat man dann versucht zu senken Und dann hat er Er hat mir erzhlt dass er bei der Nachtschicht immer so Oberbauchschmerzen hat Und das war so dass die Magenbehandlung nichts gebracht hat habe ich mal gedacht Naja vielleicht ist das vom Herzen Dann war er beim Kardiologen und ist auch flug in die Kardiologie in die HerzVorax gekommen und ist gesendet worden Ja und dann fing er an mit Gehbeschwerden Und dann fing die AVK an in den Beinen Und da hat er jetzt schon Stems in der Femoralis in der IliakaExterna Und das hat er gerade nochmal Links jetzt hat er rechts auch noch Stems bekommen in der IliakaExterna Speaker 1 00:07:09 Oje Abschluss Speaker 2 00:07:11 Claudicatio und ist also auch beim Angiologen regelmig Und ja der hat das Er hat das halt zur Kenntnis genommen mit dem Nilemto Ich habe ihm gesagt sagen Sie ihm das mal dass ich Sie da umgestellt habe Und ja BimbaStatin hat er auch noch Speaker 1 00:07:29 Ja genau Das ist praktisch so als Nustendi auch als Addon zu den Statinen Dann hat er praktisch dann das Statin dann hat er das Ectinib und dann hat er die Bempidoinsure Ja er Speaker 2 00:07:48 Hat das Ectron 2010 Also das ist dann nehme ich an Bimba mit Ectinib Speaker 1 00:07:59 Ah okay Das ist Speaker 2 00:08:02 Dann laufend und dann noch das Nilemto dabei Speaker 1 00:08:05 Eben Ansonsten knnen Sie es ja so machen dass Sie praktisch dann das Statin was er eh schon nimmt und dann einfach Nustendi Und so Speaker 2 00:08:17 So ja Speaker 1 00:08:19 Genau Und da hat er dann auch nur dann zwei Tabletten Speaker 2 00:08:24 Ja das Speaker 1 00:08:25 Ist okay In der Komplex Das ist so ein Punkt fr ihn vielleicht auch ein bisschen einfacher Hand zu Hand haben Ja Trotzdem Speaker 2 00:08:31 Ja okay Speaker 1 00:08:33 Es gibt nmlich noch eine ClearOutcomeStudie und die wurde jetzt beendet dass man praktisch dann auch bei Hochrisikopatienten kardiovaskulre Ereignisse und zwar in der schweren Form 13 Prozent senkt Also dass man da einfach dann auch In dieser Richtung was Sie jetzt auch mir gerade schilderten da auch Daten hat die die Verordnung einfach noch mal besttigen Dass er da wirklich nebenbei auch noch nicht nur die LDLCWertsenkung hat sondern auch die Risikosenkung Speaker 2 00:09:06 Ja also der ist schon im Gesamtcholesterin bei 104 im LDLC bei 36 Ah Ah Der ist ja immer immer immer niedrig 268 Speaker 1 00:09:19 Ah okay Oh das ist ja sehr niedrig Und die Speaker 2 00:09:21 AVK schreitet trotzdem fort Speaker 1 00:09:24 Ach verflixte Kiste Hm Speaker 2 00:09:27 Ja Speaker 1 00:09:28 Naja Vielleicht vielleicht knnen wir es dann praktisch mit Nostendi oder so vielleicht knnen wir es dann wieder ein bisschen knnen wir es aufhalten ne weil das ist dann einfach dann auch ja diese Zielwerte sind ja auch sehr ambitioniert ne Ich wei nicht wie Speaker 2 00:09:46 Du das nennst Ist das nicht nur das Ecetimib oder ist da was anderes drin fr die Triglyceride Speaker 1 00:09:53 Im Nostendi ist die Bempidoinsure plus Ecetimib ne Das Linemdo ist ja pure Bempidoinsure ne genau Speaker 2 00:10:01 Nur ja das Ecetimib bringt ihm nicht viel Speaker 1 00:10:06 Ne genau Naja vielleicht probieren Sie es mit Nostendi Vielleicht ist es auch eine ComplianceFrage oder so Und dann hm Muss man dann vielleicht einen Schritt weitergehen oder so ne mit der LDLZielwertung mit den PCSK9Hemmern aber ich wrde es erstmal mit Nostendi versuchen Und mit dem Statin in der Hchstdosis so oder so wie er es vertrgt ne und dann hm ihn weiter beobachten wie das wie er sich entwickelt ne Ansonsten muss man dann vielleicht hrtere Bandagen anwenden ne wenn es dann einfach zu zu lange auch dauert ne Man h Sie als Therapeut mchten ja dann auch h Fortschritte sehen ne wenn Sie was rezeptieren dass sich das bewegt hm und h da kann ich Sie verstehen ne dass das dann auch h fr Sie dann h besser ist ne Einfach die Fortschritte ne Aber ich wrde es einfach so machen oder oder hm wei nicht aber da hat er das Atorvastatin dann schon Speaker 1 00:11:10 Und wenn das Simvastatin vielleicht nicht ganz ausreicht vielleicht das Atorvastatin nehmen und dann das Nostendi Wei ich nicht genau Vielleicht wre das auch noch ne hm Speaker 2 00:11:18 hm Speaker 1 00:11:19 Einfach ne Option Ich wei es nicht genau Mir kam das jetzt einfach so als Gedanke weil Sie sagten Simvastatin ne Aber es geht ja auch um die Vertrglichkeit ne Er muss es ja auch vertragen ne Speaker 2 00:11:33 Ja Speaker 1 00:11:34 Nun wei ich jetzt nicht h mit dem Statin kenne ich mich nicht ganz so aus h wie das dann ist mit dem Atorvastatin Ob das besser vertragen wird Speaker 2 00:11:41 Nachgucken was wir schon alles probiert haben Speaker 1 00:11:44 Eben Sie schauen in ihrer sie schauen in ihrer Dokumentation ne genau Und und wnsche Ihnen dann viel Glck und Erfolg bei h bei der Therapie von diesem Patienten ne Der ja doch schon einige Odyssee hinter sich hat ne Genau Super Ne sehr schn Ich h freue mich wenn man h dann auch so ein paar Patientenbilder hm h nochmal vor Augen bekommt von den rzten Und da lerne ich auch immer ganz viel dazu ne Ja Mhm Speaker 2 00:12:16 Dann wnsche ich Ihnen noch einen schnen Tag Speaker 1 00:12:19 Ja Ich bedanke mich bei Ihnen fr das h sehr gute Gesprch ne Und h wnsche Ihnen auch einen schnen Tag und dann bis zum nchsten Mal Ja Mhm Danke Speaker 2 00:12:29 Frau Dorn Wiederhren Speaker 1 00:12:31 Tschss Mhm", "segments": "[\"Speaker 0

nmlich auch in der N3 Ne Speaker 2 00:02:37 Ja Speaker 1 00:02:38 Sodass man da praktisch dann eher in dieser Kombination dass man dann in dieser Kombination dass man dann in dieser Kombination dann eher in dieser Kombination dann in der Dauertherapie dann natrlich dann auch die N3 zur Verfgung hat So hatten wir das gedacht Speaker 2 00:02:48 Und Speaker 1 00:02:49 Das EZTMeb wird er bestimmt auch bekommen und dann hat man das einfach zusammenfassen Speaker 2 00:03:20 So Speaker 1 00:03:24 Hatten wir das dann einfach gedacht Ja Speaker 2 00:03:27 Das haben wir auch gedacht Ach das ist gut Ja das ist gut Ich mache mir gerade eine Notiz bei Ihnen Speaker 1 00:03:33 Ja super Dass wir dann beim nchsten Mal daran denken dass man das einfach zusammenfassen kann Und dann auch ist das natrlich dann auch wirtschaftlicher Speaker 2 00:03:44 Natrlich Speaker 1 00:03:46 Darum geht es ja auch immer bei Ihnen Speaker 2 00:03:50 Da hatte ich das gerade Ach er hat es gerade am 81 gerade geholt Aber er kommt so demnchst Speaker 1 00:03:58 Eben genau Speaker 2 00:04:01 Ja Ja super Speaker 1 00:04:02 Sehr schn Da freue ich mich dass ich Ihnen da kurz helfen konnte Denn unser Zielpatient ist ja doch dann der Hochrisikopatient mit koronarer Herzkrankheit und so weiter Speaker 2 00:04:13 Ja Und Speaker 1 00:04:15 Dass es einfach noch ein greres Benefit fr ihn ist kardiovaskulre Erkrankungen dann vorzubeugen Ja Zumindest zu minimieren Wollen wir so sagen Speaker 2 00:04:27 Ja Speaker 1 00:04:28 Ja Ja Ja Also der Therapiealgorithmus ist dann einfach um die Bempiduinsure des Nusdendi einzusetzen ist einfach dann indem man zwei Statine ausreizt das Ezedemib ausreizt und wenn dann das Ganze nicht noch nicht in ihr Zielwert ist dass man dann das NiLemDoNusdendi einsetzen kann bevor man diese teuren PCSK9 immer nimmt ne so Speaker 2 00:04:50 Gibt es denn da irgendwelche Formalitten die ich beachten muss bei der Verordnung Speaker 1 00:04:57 Ja Sie mssen mindestens zwei Statine ausgereizt haben und darunter auch das Arthorastatin also das Neueste Wenn das nicht funktioniert ist das dann ja dann Icetimib Speaker 2 00:05:16 Auch Speaker 1 00:05:18 Und wenn diese beiden Sachen dann im LDLZielwert noch nicht erreicht wurden und es ist ein Patient mit hohem oder sehr hohem Risiko knnen Sie dann die Bambytoinsure nehmen So ist der Algorithmus Ja Speaker 2 00:05:38 Gut Das ging schon los vor Jahren Ja Ja das ist interessant Speaker 1 00:05:49 Ich lerne immer was dazu bei welchen Patienten das eingesetzt wird und das ist immer spannend zu hren Speaker 2 00:05:57 Ja den habe ich schon ber 20 Jahre in meiner Behandlung und er hat immer extreme CholesterinWerte gehabt LDL Und das hat man dann versucht zu senken Und dann hat er Er hat mir erzhlt dass er bei der Nachtschicht immer so Oberbauchschmerzen hat Und das war so dass die Magenbehandlung nichts gebracht hat habe ich mal gedacht Naja vielleicht ist das vom Herzen Dann war er beim Kardiologen und ist auch flug in die Kardiologie in die HerzVorax gekommen und ist gesendet worden Ja und dann fing er an mit Gehbeschwerden Und dann fing die AVK an in den Beinen Und da hat er jetzt schon Stems in der Femoralis in der IliakaExterna Und das hat er gerade nochmal Links jetzt hat er rechts auch noch Stems bekommen in der IliakaExterna Speaker 1 00:07:09 Oje Abschluss Speaker 2 00:07:11 Claudicatio und ist also auch beim Angiologen regelmig Und ja der hat das Er hat das halt zur Kenntnis genommen mit dem Nilemto Ich habe ihm gesagt sagen Sie ihm das mal dass ich Sie da umgestellt habe Und ja BimbaStatin hat er auch noch Speaker 1 00:07:29 Ja genau Das ist praktisch so als Nustendi auch als Addon zu den Statinen Dann hat er praktisch dann das Statin dann hat er das Ectinib und dann hat er die Bempidoinsure Ja er Speaker 2 00:07:48 Hat das Ectron 2010 Also das ist dann nehme ich an Bimba mit Ectinib Speaker 1 00:07:59 Ah okay Das ist Speaker 2 00:08:02 Dann laufend und dann noch das Nilemto dabei Speaker 1 00:08:05 Eben Ansonsten knnen Sie es ja so machen dass Sie praktisch dann das Statin was er eh schon nimmt und dann einfach Nustendi Und so Speaker 2 00:08:17 So ja Speaker 1 00:08:19 Genau Und da hat er dann auch nur dann zwei Tabletten Speaker 2 00:08:24 Ja das Speaker 1 00:08:25 Ist okay In der Komplex Das ist so ein Punkt fr ihn vielleicht auch ein bisschen einfacher Hand zu Hand haben Ja Trotzdem Speaker 2 00:08:31 Ja okay Speaker 1 00:08:33 Es gibt nmlich noch eine ClearOutcomeStudie und die wurde jetzt beendet dass man praktisch dann auch bei Hochrisikopatienten kardiovaskulre Ereignisse und zwar in der schweren Form 13 Prozent senkt Also dass man da einfach dann auch In dieser Richtung was Sie jetzt auch mir gerade schilderten da auch Daten hat die die Verordnung einfach noch mal besttigen Dass er da wirklich nebenbei auch noch nicht nur die LDLCWertsenkung hat sondern auch die Risikosenkung Speaker 2 00:09:06 Ja also der ist schon im Gesamtcholesterin bei 104 im LDLC bei 36 Ah Ah Der ist ja immer immer immer niedrig 268 Speaker 1 00:09:19 Ah okay Oh das ist ja sehr niedrig Und die Speaker 2 00:09:21 AVK schreitet trotzdem fort Speaker 1 00:09:24 Ach verflixte Kiste Hm Speaker 2 00:09:27 Ja Speaker 1 00:09:28 Naja Vielleicht vielleicht knnen wir es dann praktisch mit Nostendi oder so vielleicht knnen wir es dann wieder ein bisschen knnen wir es aufhalten ne weil das ist dann einfach dann auch ja diese Zielwerte sind ja auch sehr ambitioniert ne Ich wei nicht wie Speaker 2 00:09:46 Du das nennst Ist das nicht nur das Ecetimib oder ist da was anderes drin fr die Triglyceride Speaker 1 00:09:53 Im Nostendi ist die Bempidoinsure plus Ecetimib ne Das Linemdo ist ja pure Bempidoinsure ne genau Speaker 2 00:10:01 Nur ja das Ecetimib bringt ihm nicht viel Speaker 1 00:10:06 Ne genau Naja vielleicht probieren Sie es mit Nostendi Vielleicht ist es auch eine ComplianceFrage oder so Und dann hm Muss man dann vielleicht einen Schritt weitergehen oder so ne mit der LDLZielwertung mit den PCSK9Hemmern aber ich wrde es erstmal mit Nostendi versuchen Und mit dem Statin in der Hchstdosis so oder so wie er es vertrgt ne und dann hm ihn weiter beobachten wie das wie er sich entwickelt ne Ansonsten muss man dann vielleicht hrtere Bandagen anwenden ne wenn es dann einfach zu zu lange auch dauert ne Man h Sie als Therapeut mchten ja dann auch h Fortschritte sehen ne wenn Sie was rezeptieren dass sich das bewegt hm und h da kann ich Sie verstehen ne dass das dann auch h fr Sie dann h besser ist ne Einfach die Fortschritte ne Aber ich wrde es einfach so machen oder oder hm wei nicht aber da hat er das Atorvastatin dann schon Speaker 1 00:11:10 Und wenn das Simvastatin vielleicht nicht ganz ausreicht vielleicht das Atorvastatin nehmen und dann das Nostendi Wei ich nicht genau Vielleicht wre das auch noch ne hm Speaker 2 00:11:18 hm Speaker 1 00:11:19 Einfach ne Option Ich wei es nicht genau Mir kam das jetzt einfach so als Gedanke weil Sie sagten Simvastatin ne Aber es geht ja auch um die Vertrglichkeit ne Er muss es ja auch vertragen ne Speaker 2 00:11:33 Ja Speaker 1 00:11:34 Nun wei ich jetzt nicht h mit dem Statin kenne ich mich nicht ganz so aus h wie das dann ist mit dem Atorvastatin Ob das besser vertragen wird Speaker 2 00:11:41 Nachgucken was wir schon alles probiert haben Speaker 1 00:11:44 Eben Sie schauen in ihrer sie schauen in ihrer Dokumentation ne genau Und und wnsche Ihnen dann viel Glck und Erfolg bei h bei der Therapie von diesem Patienten ne Der ja doch schon einige Odyssee hinter sich hat ne Genau Super Ne sehr schn Ich h freue mich wenn man h dann auch so ein paar Patientenbilder hm h nochmal vor Augen bekommt von den rzten Und da lerne ich auch immer ganz viel dazu ne Ja Mhm Speaker 2 00:12:16 Dann wnsche ich Ihnen noch einen schnen Tag Speaker 1 00:12:19 Ja Ich bedanke mich bei Ihnen fr das h sehr gute Gesprch ne Und h wnsche Ihnen auch einen schnen Tag und dann bis zum nchsten Mal Ja Mhm Danke Speaker 2 00:12:29 Frau Dorn Wiederhren Speaker 1 00:12:31 Tschss Mhm\"]", "docker_feteched": true, "created_at": "2024-05-22T12:33:15.072Z"}},

DR Yes of course does everyone want to introduce themselves JDr Hi Im Julie one of the junior doctors working alongside Dr Lewis at the moment MSL Great to meet you Julie can I ask what stage youre at in your training JDr Sure Im an F2 so still pretty early on MSL Well its great to meet you thanks for joining the meeting NS Hi Im Sally the Lung Specialist Nurse MSL Brilliant lovely to meet you Sally Thanks for introducing yourselves are we expecting anyone else DR I dont think so MSL Great thank you Let me introduce myself Im Laurence from Pharmapro and I am here in response to a medical request you made through my colleague Louise I would like to take you through the data regarding Avant which is licensed in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced or locally advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer that have progressed following first line treatment with platinum chemotherapy Is that what you were expecting this meeting to be about DR Yes thats what I was hoping for MSL Excellent my aim is that by the end of the presentation I will have provided you with the information you need to support your treatment decisions for your patients I am keen to answer any questions you may have so do please ask questions as we go through the data Dr Great thanks MSL Did any of you get the opportunity to attend the virtual ASCO meeting last month Dr Yes I did it was a really great meeting MSL Fantastic I got to attend several of the sessions myself and was really impressed with the data and advancements in patient care that I saw Dr Yes I really enjoy ASCO as there is always so much great content MSL What presentation stood out for you Dr So many of them to be honest but the ones I found most interesting were the ones with the new biomarkers its incredible how much we are discovering now in terms of targets for treatment and indicators for disease MSL I know its incredible and so promising for patients and clinicians alike Did you attend any of the presentations about Avant or ELC testing Dr Yes you couldnt really miss it there seemed to be a lot of studies being presented on both the drug and the testing MSL Yeah theres a significant level of interest in exploring what both the treatment and the test can offer lung cancer patients who have advanced disease as you know these patients can be very challenging to manage Can I ask what you remember from the presentations you observed Dr Of course I know that your phase 3 study showed an improvement in progression free survival as well as overall survival and I understand that the particular protein the drug targets sorry I cant remember the name of the protein but the protein is present in over 50 of patients is that correct MSL Fantastic it sounds like you have a good handle on the key elements can I just ask your colleagues how much they know about Avant Julie Sally JDr I have to admit I know very little about this treatment so I am looking forward to learning from you NS I have heard bits and bobs and I know as a team we are looking to start testing so it would be helpful to know a bit more MSL Ok great well if this works for you I propose that I take you through the data and the testing set up and then we can leave some time for any questions you may have should take about 15 minutes does that sound ok Dr Perfect thank you MSL Can I ask what discussions you have had to date with the other consultants about it Dr Well after ASCO I brought it up at a recent MDT meeting we had MSL Was that in relation to a specific patient you were discussing Dr No not really MSL Ok just a general conversation about treatment options Dr NODS Yeah pretty much MSL In terms of the testing element what information are you looking for specifically Dr SCRATCHES HEADTHINKS Best method of testing for the protein and the sensitivity of the test are both important to know MSL NODS Ok I have a few slides on that here As you may be aware its a simple immunohistochemistry test you just need access to the antibody Dr SITS FORWARD Where do we get the antibody from MSL You can order it direct from the company Dr Do we need a special testing kit MSL You can purchase an ELC readytouse assay I have a leaflet I can leave on that showing the details Dr Will the pathologists understand all of this MSL Yes they should be very familiar with these types of tests Dr Ok so what are the tissue requirements to be able to perform the test MSL Thats a good question As you know tissue is difficult to get in lung cancer cases and the requirements in terms of size of sample is not that high it is more important that the sample contains as many cancer cells as possible Dr So any sample is better than nothing in terms of size MSL I think in the discovery phase as you build your experience it would make sense to test as many samples as possible It might be worth speaking to your pathologists to check but I would imagine their expectations in terms of tissue sample would be similar across the board Dr Well I suppose so I guess we always try to get a good sample MSL In terms of the cut offs they looked at whether a sample contained 25 50 or 75 positive tumour cells and it was deemed that the ELC expression was high if the sample contained greater than 50 of cells expressing the protein Which means that if 50 or more of the cancer cells in the sample expresses the protein then the drug should work Dr Does that mean we would only use Avant in those patients who have 50 or greater expression MSL Yes thats correct Dr What percentage of patients would you expect to have 50 ELC expression in their tumours MSL The current data which I am showing on the screen which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Professor Sykes in 2018 suggests up to 65 of advanced or locally advanced nonsmall cell tumours may have some expression of ELC the level of expression within the individuals is not yet known which is why everyone who could be eligible for treatment should be tested Dr Ok I see Do you need to rebiopsy when they progress MSL The data supports use of either material from the initial biopsy or from a second biopsy following progression as its difficult to get tissue for the initial diagnosis I imagine it must be even harder the second time round Do you rebiopsy many patients at progression Dr We do if we can just in case the cancer has mutated but its not always possible MSL Yes we hear from a lot of clinicians that getting access to good tissue samples is particularly challenging Dr It can be we do a lot of EBUS at this hospital are cytology samples ok to use MSL If they can be formalin fixed into a block and sliced then yes Dr Ok I think thats what they do with them maybe another one for me to check with the pathologists MAKES A NOTE MSL If you would like me to support with any of the information you want to discuss with the pathologists then please let me know Dr Yes I might need some support will see how I get on first MSL Ok so thats it in terms of the test is there any other information you would like to know on that matter Dr I dont think so sounds like I need to speak to the pathologists first MSL No problem and as I said I can support with any information if you need me to NS We have a meeting with Dr Williamson the pathologist at the end of the week would you like me to add it to the agenda Dr Yes please Sally that would be great Dr Are you able to send me those slides you have MSL These ones on the detail around the testing requirements Dr Yes then I could forward them on to Dr Williamson MSL Yes thats no problem at all I can do that Dr Thanks MSL When you have introduced a new diagnostic test previously what process did you follow to ensure it was integrated with minimal disruption to the turn around times of results Dr To be honest the pathologists do most of that we just let them know which patients need testing when we have the MDT meeting MSL Ok I see whilst I understand that the pathologists take the lead on it is there anything that you would improve about the process you currently have for identifying which patients require which diagnostic test Dr To be honest it works pretty well I do think we should be quicker at adopting new tests though MSL Is there anything specific you think that could be done LEANS FORWARD Dr Probably not a lot of it comes down to funding within the trust and getting things through approval MSL That is similar in every trust to be honest Dr Yes I think it is a standard issue NODS IN AGREEMENT MSL Shall we have a look at the data now Dr Yes please MSL Is there anything particular any of you would like me to focus on Dr An overview of the phase 3 trial would be useful for me NS Id be keen to understand what side effects we are likely to see and how to manage them please MSL Of course we can certainly cover that Can everyone see the title slide with the study name on it DrJDrNS Yes all together MSL The phase 3 study was a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled multinational and multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of Avant in combination with Docetaxel as second line therapy in patients with advanced or locally advanced NSCLC following first line treatment with platinumbased chemotherapy The primary outcomes measured were progression free survival and overall survival and the secondary outcome measured was change in patient reported outcomes Can you tell me what the title of the slide is that you can see on the screen Dr InclusionExclusion Criteria MSL Great well as you can see these were in the inclusion and exclusion criteria as you can see patients in the study had all progressed after 6 cycles of platinumbased chemotherapy There were 602 patients in the study randomised to one of two arms Any patients who had received any other systemic treatment for their cancer other than the platinumbased chemo were excluded from the study The results are now showing on the screen and were as follows: Objective response rate 45 vs 21 progression free survival 63 months vs 21 months and overall survival of 121 months vs 96 months You can see on the graph here the separation of the curves and a hazard ratio of 07 In terms of the patient recorded outcomes when looking at cough chest pain fatigue and loss of appetite Participants reported on average a 25 improvement in symptom scores across all measures What stands out for you in that data Dr Its certainly encouraging outcomes NS Im pleased to see the improvement in symptom scores for these patients quality of life is so important MSL Absolutely its important that we look at the impact on patients lives as well as the efficacy of the treatment Dr Could you just remind of the dosing again MSL Certainly let me just pull the dosing slide up for you can you see that The dose is weight dependent and is an infusion but the treatment schedule is as follows: Avant Docetaxel every 3 weeks or Placebo Docetaxel every 3 weeks Dr So you say its weight based whats the calculation MSL Its 02mgkg Dr And how often is that given MSL Its given on Day 1 of each 3weekly cycle alongside Docetaxel Dr Sally can you make a note of that for the nurses on the chemo suite NS Yes no problem at all Do you have the Adverse Events information you can show MSL Yes of course let me just pull the slide up Can you see the slide entitled Treatment Emergent Adverse Events NS Yes we can see that MSL Perfect antibody drug conjugates tend to be well tolerated because they deliver the cytotoxic payload into the tumour cell meaning that very little goes into the healthy tissue however like any treatment there are side effects What this slide shows you is the incidence of each of the reported adverse events is there anything particular that stands out for you NS Emmmm It actually looks like its generally well tolerated Im quite surprised Are there any particular things we need to consider to mitigate the risks MSL Not particularly just the usual supportive treatments you would use for patients with this stage cancer NS Ok great thank you MSL Is there anything else you would like me to show you in terms of the data Dr No I think we have enough there to be going on with MSL Great so in terms of next steps how do you plan to take this forward as a team Dr I think we will discuss it again at the MDT I also need to catch up with Dr Williamson to discuss the pathology set up MSL What additional information or support do you need from me Dr I think it would be good if you could send me the slides you have shown us today so I can reference them when discussing with ym colleagues MSL Of course would you be interested in signing up to our Clinical Paper Portal which would give you access to all the clinical studies for Avant Dr That sounds helpful what would I need to do MSL If youre happy for me to pass your email address on to my colleague in our Medical Information department they will create you an account and send you the link Dr Yes that would be great thank you MSL I also note from the registrations that you have signed up to our upcoming webinar The Evolution of Treatments for Advanced Lung Cancer Sally Julie would you like me to send you the information on the webinar JDr Yes please that would be interesting NS Sure Ill take a look MSL Dr Lewis the webinar will focus on some case studies that are developing is this something you might be interested in being involved in Dr I might be Id need to know a bit more MSL Would it be ok to reach out to you after the webinar to discuss in more depth Dr Yes that would be fine MSL Ok well Im conscious of time I will send out the webinar information and get Dr Lewis set up on the clinical paper portal I know you have plans to speak to your pathologist and the wider team please do let me know if you need any support with that Dr Will do many thanks MSL Your welcome look forward to speaking with you all again ALL Bye thanks bye etc", "segments": "[\"MSL Hello Dr Lewis can you

to take this forward as a team Dr I think we will discuss it again at the MDT I also need to catch up with Dr Williamson to discuss the pathology set up MSL What additional information or support do you need from me Dr I think it would be good if you could send me the slides you have shown us today so I can reference them when discussing with ym colleagues MSL Of course would you be interested in signing up to our Clinical Paper Portal which would give you access to all the clinical studies for Avant Dr That sounds helpful what would I need to do MSL If youre happy for me to pass your email address on to my colleague in our Medical Information department they will create you an account and send you the link Dr Yes that would be great thank you MSL I also note from the registrations that you have signed up to our upcoming webinar The Evolution of Treatments for Advanced Lung Cancer Sally Julie would you like me to send you the information on the webinar JDr Yes please that would be interesting NS Sure Ill take a look MSL Dr Lewis the webinar will focus on some case studies that are developing is this something you might be interested in being involved in Dr I might be Id need to know a bit more MSL Would it be ok to reach out to you after the webinar to discuss in more depth Dr Yes that would be fine MSL Ok well Im conscious of time I will send out the webinar information and get Dr Lewis set up on the clinical paper portal I know you have plans to speak to your pathologist and the wider team please do let me know if you need any support with that Dr Will do many thanks MSL Your welcome look forward to speaking with you all again ALL Bye thanks bye etc\"]", "docker_feteched": true, "created_at": "2024-05-22T12:46:25.610Z"}}, {"model": "analysis.transcription", "pk":

exciting information about Gaboderm ointment for your moderate to severe eczema patients These are patients who are having frequent flares so the chances are that youll be seeing them in the practice on a regular basis It would be great if you could identify one of these patients to use Gaboderm in and see how it reduces their flares for yourself Would that be okay GP :Yes certainly Rep:Who is it

otherwise good HCPP Ah busy is a way of life these days isnt it HCP It certainly is HCPP Well thank you for taking the time to speak with me today I know we discussed GABODERM last time we met and we covered some of the basics but I really believe its an outstanding drug that could be life changing for the right patients Could we revisit your adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis please Id love you to have the confidence to want to try GABODERM in one of these patients if that is okay with you HCP Yes of course HCPP Last time we met you mentioned that you were one of the first to try secretamab and it had become one of your routine treatments for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis HCP Yes thats right HCPP Could you tell me what was it that triggered you to try it for the first time and what did you see that made you decide to make it one of your mainstay treatments HCP Well let me think I seem to remember it was one of the first new treatments we had for plaque psoriasis for years and wed not really had anything that effective We had to try a whole gamut of treatments in combination to achieve any kind of significant improvement for patients emollients steroids UV So when I saw the data for secretamab it was outstanding and compared to what wed experienced before I just had to try it From there it lived up to my kind of reserved expectations and I was truly amazed Its been a mainstay ever since HCPP Thank you for sharing that There have been other new products launched in this area since but you dont seem to have adopted any of those what would a new treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis have to demonstrate for you to have that I must try it moment again HCP It really has to offer something significant in terms of efficacy Clear space between it and secretamab HCPP And when you say efficacy what would that be for you PASI 90 speed what exactly for you HCP With secretamab it was initially PASI 90 it was just so far out ahead of what we had at the time Otherwise the things Im looking for are initial speed of action and sustained effectiveness I dont want it waring off in other words HCPP Okay so if I want you to have that I must try it moment again I need to demonstrate efficacy PASI 90 and if possible significant improvements over current treatment Speed of action and that it will not ware off over time Is that correct HCP Yes if you can do that Ill be impressed HCPP Okay I think I can let me show you the RADIANT Study Now although this is a UCB sponsored study it was peer reviewed and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2021 It was a head to head doubleblind randomised study of 743 moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients compared to secretamab which you have been routinely using It this okay to present HCP Yes its not very often we get new drugs compared to something we routinely use so yes Im very interested to see what it says HCPP Well here the Yaxis shows the percentage of patients achieving PASI 90 and the Xaxis shows the number of weeks of treatment What you can see is that GABODERM moves ahead of secretamab quite early and by week 4 349 of patients have achieved PASI 90 compared to just 175 of the secretamab group Any comments yet HCP Not yet please carry on HCPP The separation is maintained and significant the PValue was less than zero point zero zero one So achieves really good PASI 90 and has significant superiority to secretamab the speed of action shows separation early and is significant at week 4 and the efficacy is maintained over time as you can see No waring off Also as you can see a high percentage of patients respond excellently to GABODERM What do you think now HCP I think I think I probably should try it HCPP Thatd be great HCP So it does raise a few questions how do I prescribe and administer GABODERM and is there anything I need to be aware of You know side effects etc HCPP So ideally wed suggest using it in a biologic nave patient so you can see just how good it is and HCP Im not sure Id use it for the first time in a biologic nave patient but I do have a couple in mind whove been struggling on their current biologics HCPP Okay thats great So how to prescribe and administer HCPP Its an initial 5 doses similar to other biologics and then switching to an 8 week interval for maintenance Overall its eight less than secretamab in the first year and less on an ongoing basis which patients will love HCP Well thats easy HCPP It comes in a handy autoinjector so patients can do this themselves at home once youve trained them HCP Excellent and side effects HCPP Similar to the others apart from you may see candidiasis in up to 1 in 8 patients but its transient and can be treated with a simple antifungal In the studies we saw very few people stop treatment due to this HCP Okay that all seems very straight forward HCPP Do you have a patient in mind and how will you ensure they receive GABODERM HCP I do have someone in mind but I know theyre not due in for a couple of weeks Also although Ill see the patient itll be the nurse that administers the first dose and has responsibility for training the patient HCPP Well could we book a meeting for you to meet the nurse and ensure she has everything she needs to start that patient on GABODERM HCP Yes lets do that HCPP Excellent also its important for you to see how well GABODERM works if its going to become one of your routine treatments Could we book another meeting a couple of weeks after the patient commences treatment so we can check the patients progress I really want you to see how fast GABODERM works HCP DIARIES COMPLETED AND DATE AGREED Yes lets book that when you come in to see the nurse HCPP Excellent Ill see you then",

lovely to see you again How are you Nurse :I am doing OK thanks Still here Still going Rep :Well thats no mean feat these days How have things been since we last met Nurse :OK I think this is our new normal now about as normal as its going to get anyway We are still working hard to clear backlogs in just about every area as well as doing the day to day stuff Rep :That must be hard going Well my hope is that what we talk about today will bring some advantages to you and your team as well as to patients Id like to carry on our conversation around CombiClean Foam Last time I saw you we talked about how it brings the benefit from healing of the Liquifil technology and the comfort of a foam and I left you a few samples to give it a try Did you manage to use it on any patients Nurse :Yes I did actually although to be honest it was a few weeks ago and then it sort of went off my agenda with everything else going on Rep : Yes sure I understand that So if you think back to those patients who you did use it on what did you and the patients think of it Nurse :On the whole I think it was positive Application and removal were fine and I think there was one patient where there was high levels of exudate and sensitivity and it seems to work fine no leakage and the patient felt comfortable Rep :Thats great to hear So would you say that you have had positive first experience with CombiClean Foam Nurse Yes so far so good Rep :Great So what Id like to do today is explore what the opportunities are to get more appropriate patients getting the benefits of CombiClean Foam by seeing if we can identify who are those appropriate patients and how we get the rest of your team up to speed with using it How does that sound Nurse :Yes thats fine with me I am just a bit cautious with change for the team at the moment so wed have to think carefully at how we do that Rep : Sure I understand that Is there anything you particularly want me to cover in our time today Nurse :I think just that how we avoid additional work for an already overstretched team Im fine with the rest of your products Rep :Yes I hear what you are saying there We need to make sure this is not burdensome for your team Thats one thing we will make sure of I know we talked about an educational session for the team and it maybe we can build something into that to ensure there is no additional burden to them What else is it that you need to hear from me today to be confident in extending your use of CombiClean Foam across the team Nurse :I think it all ties into not putting additional work on the team Keeping it simple If we introduce this wider then how do we keep it nice and simple for the team How can they very simply identify who this should be used with Rep :Ok so what Im hearing is that to introduce CombiClean Foam we need to find a way to keep it simple to make it very clear to your nurses how they simply identify appropriate patients and that there is not going to be additional work caused for them Is that right Nurse Yes thats correct Rep :Ok so here is my suggestion Let me go through with you the makeup of a CombiClean Foam dressing Because you will see it combines two technologies that your team are already familiar with so we can help them see its actually combing the advantages of two products they are also already familiar with and also I think this will help see how simple it would be to roll this out to them and how I think it will also be simple to give clear guidance on which patients How does that sound Nurse :Yes OK Rep :Great So I have a sample here again Takes out sample but keeps holding it herself that brings together some of the key advantages that you and other customers have said you like in our other products ones that you are already familiar with So you can see it looks like our Liquifil dressing that you currently use but with the addition of a foam layer so you get that vertical wicking that absorption of exudate in the same way as you do with Liquifil to ensure wounds dont get worse and there is reduced risk of maceration Ill show you in just a moment how it does that but you also get the comfort and protection of a foam dressing in this additional third layer :Let me show you what I mean puts dressing down and gets out iPad because of the unique way CombiClean Foam houses the Liquifil fibre in small celllike structures the fibre will draw up the exudate safely away from the wound and ensure that it doesnt spread I can show you how that looks like on here Shows iPad Now this is information is taken from the user guide so its available for both nurse and patients both in paper and electronic form and we would show this in training for your team And you can see here gestures to next page on iPad this is how the layers work together You have the confidence that it will give you that same high quality wound care that you have become used to with Liquifil and in addition you have a skin friendly and gentle contact area that will give minimal pain on removal and consistent protection for up to a week And it comes in the normal selection of sizes and as it can be cut to shape it is very flexible and can be used on many different body areas So you have that simplicity you were talking about you dont have so think too much about is this the right dressing or not because it is so flexible in its use I would suggest that to identify the right patient think Are you needing to ensure good vertical wicking for exudate and do they need the extra protection of a foam dressing If the answer is yes then use CombiClean Foam Nurse :OK well that sounds positive I certainly found it worked well with the few patients I tried we will just need to show the team this so they have confidence to try it I know you said it is containing familiar elements but it is still a new dressing so they will need convincing Rep :Sure I understand that I have quite a lot of detail which we could share during any training but I wont go through it all now but let me just show you one more thing shows iPad again :This shows the cell structure of that layer in more detail Each cell is interconnected so they work together to draw up that exudate and so although it is not in main contact with the skin it will still draw that exudate up and retain and trap it so it doesnt go back on the skin So you get the healing of the Liquifil technology and the comfort of a foam This is the sort of thing we can use to reassure them There is also a White paper that captures all this Would that be OK Nurse :Remind me of the cost Rep :It is the same cost as Liquifil so there is also that reassurance around budget Nurse :Great Thats a relief I think you told me that last time but I had to check Cant escape budgets these days Rep :Sure I understand So we have talked about how CombiClean works combining how it brings the benefit of the Liquifil technology and the comfort of a foam and we have looked at how we can simplify identifying suitable patients and how we can include this in training for your team What do you think the next steps are in getting CombiClean Foam rolled out to the team and ensure more patients get the benefits Nurse :I think we just need to set up a time to do some training with the team but thats not always easy these days Rep :Sure I think last time we talked about concerns that some of the new nurses are missing out on their training with all thats gone on over the last couple of years so perhaps we could look to identify any of those knowledge gaps so as we roll out CombiClean foam we could add in those things that would also be helpful to your team Nurse:Thats a great idea That would be really helpful Rep :Super Well we have our nurse trainer Sarah who I know has come in before to do some training for you Why dont you have a think about what else would be helpful for her to cover in the meantime lets get diaries out and see if we can find a date Nurse :OK Lets see We did have some time at the beginning of next months team meeting set aside for training so lets look at that Thats 7th April lunchtime hows that Rep :Great I will contact Sarah and confirm that So you will let me know about topics Are you happy that we do the training in person rather than virtually Nurse :Yes we are fine with that now Rep :Good I will get Sarah to cover what we agreed on CombiClean Foam around how it works and patient types What else needs to be in place for your team to be ready to use once we have done the training Nurse :Wed need some dressing in stock and have agreed with pharmacy to do an evaluation before we get regular orders in Rep :If it helps I can speak to pharmacy about that and make arrangements What would be helpful is if you could just let them know this is your plan Would that be alright Nurse :Yes sure Our pharmacist is on the ward now so we could pop down and see her right now if that works Rep :Excellent Is there anything else we need to cover now Nurse :No I think weve covered everything Rep :Great Thanks for your time and lets go and see the pharmacist then Nurse :OK lets go", "segments": "[\"Rep :Good morning Tom its lovely to see

zufrieden von der Zielwertsenkung Ja Ah super Denn der Zielpatient ist ja auch der Hochrisikopatient oder der KAKPatient weil er davon eigentlich super profitiert in Form dass die Studien einfach dann so gelegt worden sind dass dann auch die kardiovaskulren Ereignisse dann reduziert worden sind Schicken Sie die meisten Patienten dann eher zum Lipidologen weil Sie sagten Sie haben nur drei Patienten die da laufen oder gehen die dann eher zum Speaker 0 00:00:57 Ja so viele sind es ja nicht die man mit anderen Mitteln nicht in den Zielwert kriegt Speaker 1 00:01:01 Ah okay Alles klar Dann haben Sie

00:00:02 I last saw Dr Shine two months ago Uh he has more recently attended the webcast with Dr Mystery where data on the mode of action was presented for bra There has been an increase in market share in the account over the last six months The last time I saw Dr Shine um he hadnt prescribed any bra there currently eight patients on bra on the in the account My understanding is that it was um Dr Kline who initiated them based on my discussions with Catherine the nurse specialist who I saw last week there is a formulary application in process that has been initiated by Dr Kline however can be prescribed for exceptional cases or on compassionate grants Currently in this trust during previous calls um Dr Shine has said that he prefers to continue with the more established drugs that he is used to uh from previous experience Dr Speaker 0 00:01:00 Shine he he isnt an innovator when it comes to new treatments He has said in previous interactions that he is cautious when prescribing very new treatments Um mental health is on the CC agenda at the moment Um Dr Shine has previously talked about the anxiety and depression that his younger adults suffer from due to their condition I am keen to focus on this group of patients during our call today I would place uh Dr Shine as as no commitment to the product on the commitment continuum as he is not prescribed the drug And hasnt identified any suitable patients yet regarding the priority reason for choosing bra is the efficacy and data Uh I have heard the customers say um my decision at this time is to maintain the current therapy for these patients So I will be aiming for him to comment along the lines of the data you have shared with me is interesting and robust Speaker 0 00:02:04 Uh Im to use the for this interaction Uh this is the first time Ive done this with Dr Shine So Ive already sent him an ensure that he has Chrome on his computer whether or not he has access to AAM and step by step instructions on how access the remote call Ive also sent him the engage link as calendar invite and I will ensure Im on the platform 15 minutes prior to the call so that I am ready for him Um Im currently uh working at home I will make sure I have no distractions uh kids dogs uh that my environment is uh well lit Um and we can clutter I will make sure I have a glass of water and my notes to hand so that Im prepared for the full interaction Um my plan for this interaction is to discuss the impact that severe psoriasis has on the younger patient group and the impact that this has on their quality of life Speaker 0 00:03:07 And selfesteem Im keen to understand Dr Shines views on this I plan to present the data on on the efficacy of bra and gain agreement that this is this directly correlates to increased quality of life scores in this younger patient cohort By the end of the engagement I would like for Dr Shine to have a good understanding of the data and that bra could be a good choice for his younger patients with severe psoriasis and and to get him to agree to trialing it I in a patient terribly failing on our topical treatment my fullback objective will be for him to identify a way in which to recognize that rather patient when they walk through the door of the clinic within the next month as this is the first time Im engaging with Dr Shine through the BVA engage platform I I will firstly ensure that that he can see and hear me clearly Speaker 0 00:04:05 Um I will introduce myself and remind him of our previous interactions I will explore his level of comfort in using the technology for our virtual engagement focusing on his interactions with uh family uh friends work colleagues uh Ill be any technical issue He may have such as his camera being off or um sound muted I will confirm how long he has available for this interaction and outline my agenda being really clear the action I want uh aim to get from him today Its to identify younger patient where he can trial bra to begin to gain experience with it I I will also um ask if Dr has any specific topics he would like to discuss with me in the time that we have together I plan to review with Dr His views on bra and his reflections and takeaways from the webcast It will be important for me to focus the and the clinical we have specifically looking at efficacy and the benefits that has on a patients quality of life due to the or mental health and the younger patient cohort in this I Dr Speaker 0 00:05:22 S experience in this patient group uh Ill be looking for signals uh to know how comfortable uh to know he is comfortable and advise him that I will check in regularly to see what he is seeing on his screen Im keen to understand Dr Sharons views on Braddon following the webcast It will be important for me to then discuss of a patient and understand what he is looking for in the treatment for this group Uh I will use a variety of questions to gain an understanding of his needs and the areas within the data uh to present to him Um questions like um in the past uh when youve successfully changed from using Nora to how did you make that decision um and what needs to for you to be able to consider trialing bran and your patients Um what would it Speaker 1 00:06:24 Uh look like Speaker 0 00:06:25 In practice if you were to prescribe bran for your younger patients and yeah And and what have you done previously to move treatment forward when things havent gone to plan Um I could also ask how important is the impact on a on a patients mental health and selfesteem for your patients Um and also uh what Speaker 1 00:06:49 What else Speaker 0 00:06:49 Is important to him when choosing a treatment for these patients Yeah I Im aim to Speaker 1 00:06:58 Im aim here Speaker 0 00:06:59 To get Dr To reflect on on a time in the past when he has changed the newer treatments and and share the impact um this had on his patients I hope that Speaker 1 00:07:11 This will help him Speaker 0 00:07:12 See helping to see that based on the the data a change would be a good choice for his younger patients Ill be looking uh closely at his body language here to ascertain how hes really feeling What is his reaction when he reflects on making treatment changes in the past I mean how has he had a a positive reaction I will um Ill look to set up the data Im about to present uh but outlining the fact that there is some data that I think he needs to see briefly to help them make a fair and accurate decision for these patients I guess Um I guess the impact study by plaque etal is is likely to be the one most aligned to the anticipated response Dr Sh you know Dr Shine to demonstrate the benefits on the dermatology of lifes um published in the general of of uh clinical dermatology in in 2016 they asked uh 1400 patients about the impact that psoriasis had on the quality of life Speaker 0 00:08:17 And this is what they found Um in addition in the 18 to 25 year old cohort the percentage of people that uh said they had low selfesteem rose from 50 to 75 And and the percentage he said that they had really felt confident rose from 41 to 82 um also plan to use the wow uh trial to um demonstrate the legs the number of patients trial on um versus ICEP and the impact of the PASI scores Um it would be important to highlight the authority of these studies particularly the wow study published in the Lance with a large study cohort And the aim is to give him the confidence that the studies are robust and therefore bra will be a good choice for his younger patients Um I will uh intend to ask him what he thinks about the data Uh I also plan to ask him if the data is reflective of his experience I would like to challenge him if appropriate on what this data could mean for his patients Speaker 0 00:09:36 In closing I will uh summarize uh our discussion and the data Ive taken through during the engagement and check if theres any further information he requires the initial the the initial high return productive question I will use is um so what needs to happen for you to be able to prescribe to try and get him to volunteer his commitment I will explore the next steps hes going to take following our discussion I will also uh confirm my actions and time scales Um finally I will then talk Dr Off the platform and ask him for in engaging remotely what worked well for him uh and anything we can do differently next time Ill also uh send a prompt approved email and look to schedule our next call Youd Speaker 2 00:10:37 Hi Good to you again Uh I think you may be mute I I can see you but I cant I cant hear you It um if you look to the bottom of your screen youll see a microphone symbol click on this uh the sound should come through Speaker 3 00:11:00 Okay Yeah Is is that is that

Im Im a little new to this so youre gonna have to uh uh bear with me Speaker 2 00:11:16 laugh yeah no problem It has a bit been a bit of a steep learning curve with this um this new way of working Uh but we are we are using a really stable platform today If for any reason we were into technical difficulties Um I could talk you through some steps to resolve them if we lose connection Um youll just need to click the link in my email again Joan or you have my mobile number on there also Speaker 3 00:11:41 Okay We do Thanks Louis Speaker 2 00:11:43 Yeah So how are you last time Uh met you were you were just heading off to see daughter in her Speaker 3 00:11:53 Of course Well she was the uh the most delightful sheep Ive ever seen laugh oh Speaker 2 00:11:58 Oh how cute Speaker 3 00:12:00 Yeah indeed Although although she was quite upset that she uh that she wasnt the donkey laugh a strange child Speaker 2 00:12:08 Well theres always next year Speaker 3 00:12:10 There certainly is Speaker 2 00:12:12 Uh and how have you been faring in this current uh very strange situation Speaker 3 00:12:17 Um no not too bad Thank you Weve been juggling the uh working and and homeschooling which has been interesting Speaker 2 00:12:26 Ah yes Yeah The homeschooling I too Im feeling that pain How are you finding it Speaker 3 00:12:32 Well Whil its lovely to spend time with the children Uh I realized that Im no teacher Speaker 2 00:12:38 laugh yeah yes Me too I feel exactly the same I think uh we all have learned some new skills over the last few months Yeah Speaker 3 00:12:46 Yeah indeed Speaker 2 00:12:47 Uh and the impact on uh trust and patience Speaker 3 00:12:52 Um well were about I start seeing our patients in virtual clinics which which would be good Speaker 2 00:12:57 Itd be great for them to Im sure Yeah To contact with you Speaker 3 00:13:02 Yeah Well the feedback so far has been really good so were pleased to try and get back to to some kind of normal Speaker 2 00:13:07 Yeah Yeah I totally understand that Um so the last time we met uh we spoke about rev and you were keen to learn more about it Um you were gonna sign up to the webcast about the mode of action with Dr Mystery Uh how did how did that go Speaker 3 00:13:23 Yeah that that was a a good meeting and I appreciated the opportunity to attend the online at home as it wouldve been what it wouldve been difficult to get to a live meeting Speaker 2 00:13:32 Great Yeah Ill Ill feed that back to the office as they like to know that these things are working Um so did the webcast change how you had been thinking about bra dermatol Speaker 3 00:13:43 Uh yes And yes and no Uh I can certainly see the benefits but uh just like all these new drugs you just cant be sure of the long term safety And and that for me is uh a big hurdle to overcome Speaker 2 00:13:56 Yeah Yeah I do understand another doctors who new tore originally have said the same um bra is new and as a result theres less long term safety data than other drugs However as with all new drugs we have lots of new data being published all the time Um and Im keen uh today to take you through some of our large studies which look at safety Speaker 3 00:14:20 OK Go on Speaker 2 00:14:21 Um in all the previous conversations that weve had youve youve made it to me that priority is the patient and that you that you treat that patient as an individual and do for them Speaker 3 00:14:34 Yeah of course Speaker 2 00:14:36 Key thing weve discussed is the patients emotional mental and social wellbeing and the impact that psoriasis has on their quality of life Um I I am aware that the CCG are heavily focused on reducing the number of patients with uh depression um and anxiety currently as they recognize the impact This has on an individual in leading a fulfilling life Um looking at the data I can see that there is a higher population of younger people here than than other areas of the potentially patients who are perhaps healthier with less comorbidities where severe psoriasis is having a real impact on their selfesteem and potentially their performance Would you agree Speaker 3 00:15:24 Yeah Yeah Speaker 2 00:15:25 Uh based on this uh I would really like to focus on this patient group today specifically one or two of your patients who are currently failing on a topical treatment um someone who needs to now move to an IV option to achieve better control of their condition and where rather could be um could could be a good choice for them based on its efficacy and the resulting impact on their quality of life Speaker 3 00:15:53 Yeah Yeah I mean that that thats fine with me I see a lot of younger people Speaker 2 00:15:57 Okay Yeah Great So if I can demonstrate the benefits of bra in this patient cohort would you be willing to try it in order to gain your own experience Speaker 3 00:16:07 Uh yes Yes It would have to be a a very good argument Speaker 2 00:16:12 It it will be good for you to try it yourself so you can see the benefits for your patients Um before we go any further is there anything on your agenda that you wish to discuss with me today Speaker 3 00:16:23 Uh well I I would be interested to see any new data that you have Speaker 2 00:16:29 Um no problem Um so uh its important I have a clear picture of what you are looking for in a treatment for these patients Uh we have discussed uh that the impact on a patients mental wellbeing is a key focus for you What else is important to you when choosing a treatment for these patients Speaker 3 00:16:49 Well something that works well and and works quickly with with with minimal side effects Speaker 2 00:16:56 Tell tell me more Speaker 3 00:16:58 Well its really I patients we get it first time uh worsen of its important We minimize the impacts of this as as as quickly as we can Speaker 2 00:17:20 Yeah I completely understand that Is there anything else you wish for us to discuss today Speaker 3 00:17:26 No no no I think were good Speaker 2 00:17:28 Okay Okay Great Let me start by showing you um yeah Start by uh you through the for the dermatology life quality index DL QI uming with the gold Okay Can I can I check You can see my slides Okay Speaker 3 00:17:54 Uh yeah Yeah there is I can I can see them Speaker 2 00:17:57 Great Great If I can draw your attention to the graph on the right hand side here Im showing you yeah Im show the impact study by at uh published in the journal of clinical dermatology in 2016 um asked 1400 patients about the impact that psoriasis had on their quality of life And this is what they found now on top of these statistics in the 18 to 25 year old cohort the percentage of people that said they had low selfesteem rose from 50 to seven And the percentage you said that they rarely felt confident rose from 41 to 82 Speaker 3 00:18:41 Wow Thats a thats a big increase Speaker 2 00:18:44 Yes it is Yeah Now its one thing me sitting here showing you statistics but Im keen to hear about what you see in your practice Speaker 3 00:18:53 Uh well um I I see youngsters that uh dont go in and socialize or integrate with their peers because they they dont feel compet in in the way that they look uh quite often its the uh its the first time that theyre away from home uh from their families they feel isolated and and lonely Uh and then that then leads them to suffer from anxiety and depression Speaker 2 00:19:24 And what impact does that have on their very reason for being away from home Um their study uh Speaker 3 00:19:33 Well the theyll find it hard to sleep uh and to concentrate being um unhappy is is an emotional drain Quite often they end up moving back home which yeah Which is a shame Speaker 2 00:19:49 Must be so challenging for these patients uh in your experience what happens next for them Speaker 3 00:19:55 Well I imagine that some of them never go on to find fulltime employment and they end up feeling very isolated Speaker 2 00:20:03 So for this patient group when they come into your clinic what is the ideal outcome for them Speaker 3 00:20:10 The ideal outcome would be to reduce the amount of their body by psoriasis and also to review reduce the severity of the lesion So the patient feels more comfortable Speaker 2 00:20:22 And when they walk outta your door how do you measure your success Speaker 3 00:20:27 Oh partly for me its more about their quality of life Uh are they able to go out and integrate and live a happy fulfill life Like they should I mean that mean thats why thats why I do what I do Speaker 2 00:20:39 Yeah So if we could achieve say closer to PAI 90 and significantly improve quality of life for for this group then would you feel that it would be a success Speaker 3 00:20:51 Yes it would But all the drugs uh that do this are so expensive which is why the hospital guideline suggests systemic second line to topical Speaker 2 00:21:06 Sorry Apologies The uh the wifi seem to um seem to drop out there Can you can you hear and see me OK Speaker 3 00:21:15 Yeah Louis I I have you back now Speaker 2 00:21:18 Great Hopefully wont have more issues if we do if we do just stay on the platform um the wifi should should catch up Um sorry Back back to your point Yeah Um I understand uh that cost has got to be part of the decision Has there been a time in the past where you have prescribed a medicine off formulary Speaker 3 00:21:41 Uh yes Yes I have I have had to do that in the past Yeah Speaker 2 00:21:45 Was there a particular reason for prescribing off formulary Speaker 3 00:21:48 It came down individual what they needed at the time uh to give them the best chance of success Speaker 2 00:21:54 So if we were to narrow this younger patient group down to an Indi an individual do you have anyone in mind who fits the criteria right now Uh someone who you are looking to move to the next step whos suffering with their mental health and selfesteem due to that can do like like the like the students you mentioned earlier Speaker 3 00:22:13 Yeah Yeah I I have one person in mind Speaker 2 00:22:17 Can we concentrate on that one person then Speaker 3 00:22:20 Okay well lets lets see what you have to say Speaker 2 00:22:24 Youve mentioned systemic drugs Am I right to saying that the preferred one is yes In the past when you changed from using NORRA toe Yeah What prompted you to make that decision Speaker 3 00:22:37 Uh well thats a good question Uh well it was based on the and Speaker 2 00:22:44 If you could further improve what would you change Speaker 3 00:22:49 Well I Id certainly improve the PASI score Its good But on average we see PASI 75 at very for this patient I dont think there would be enough to improve Selfesteem Id also improve the side effects Associa with it see a nausea dizziness Speaker 2 00:23:08 Okay Um those side effects have on on the patients Speaker 3 00:23:14 Well sometimes they end up canceling the appointments for their injection and then they dont reschedule until their psoriasis is so bad that they dont have another option or sometimes occasionally theyre theyre so ill Speaker 2 00:23:29 So what would you from for me to convince you that bra is right for this patient that you have in mind Speaker 3 00:23:38 Well I would need to see that the results for this patient in terms of PAI score and quality of of life outweigh my concerns about the risk of taking a new drug Speaker 2 00:23:48 Right Well can I show you the data we have so far OK Can you see can you see my screen OK Um this slide is titled the wow trial Speaker 3 00:24:01 Yeah Yeah I can see it Speaker 2 00:24:02 Great Um there is quite a bit of info on here So Im going to draw your attention firstly to the study design as you can see this study was published in the Lance in 2017 it was a randomized uh multicenter head to head trial comparing bra against and intercept uh total number of patients 3000 and the trial for three years Well Speaker 3 00:24:27 That thats thats a big trial for for a lot longer than I expected Speaker 2 00:24:30 Yeah And if I now draw your attention to the graph uh you can clearly see the study compared with the most commonly used Can you see uh the graph Speaker 2 00:24:44 Um you can see the next to the right of the graph that um patients in the trial had severe psoriasis defined as a Pazi level more than 15 And patients had all been on topical treatment and were at the point of needing the next step up Um they were then randomized to receive one of the three treatment arms shows the primary endpoint uh was the improvement in PA scores and the results were as follows So the the percentage of patients who achieve PASI 90 has a 90 improvement in PAI uh score on 50 mmhmm affirmative on incept 75 and on bra 90 furthermore 89 of pat 89 of patients on bra achieved PAI 90 for the four three years remaining on bra Whereas the me percentage that remained on intercept was 57 and for eight 54 So this means that the patient were focusing on is highly likely to achieve PA 90 for a four three years on bra Um how how would that impact her life do you think Speaker 3 00:26:03 Uh I mean that would have a hugely positive uh impact on on her confidence and and self esteem Speaker 2 00:26:13 And what would that allow her to do that She currently cant Speaker 3 00:26:16 Well shed be able to integrate with her peers Uh shes about noting but this this this thence to just be herself again Speaker 2 00:26:27 Yeah What would for you Speaker 3 00:26:29 Oh my aim is is to get these patients as well as possible as quickly as possible Id please Speaker 2 00:26:36 So the results look good So um lets can you see the scores here Speaker 3 00:26:47 Uh yep Yeah I can see them Speaker 2 00:26:50 Um a secondary measure in the trial was a reduction in the DQ I score from baseline And as you can see from the graph here patients Onder scored a better quality of life than for of the the other treatments and at each year And now for the other treatments you can see here that the quality of life school started to drop in response to the treatment efficacy starting to drop Whereas bra continue to be better than baseline This means that your patient will continue to feel happier and and more confident and will hope on to fulfill her So uh what you thinking now Speaker 3 00:27:31 Well Im thinking is youve Speaker 2 00:27:43 To just change the slides if you yeah If you look to the box and the center of the slide you can see yeah The re the number of adverse events that were recorded Yeah Are you with me Speaker 3 00:27:59 Yeah Yeah And were Speaker 2 00:28:01 Great So here you can see that the adverse events were significantly lower for Brava then the other treatment arms uh and and 90 of the adverse events were related to the infusion All of which were mild by nature and can be managed using premed premeds Um so so what do you think of the wow trial data overall Speaker 3 00:28:23 It looks really good Um Im impressed by the number of patients and the the length of the trial Speaker 2 00:28:29 Has this demonstrated that for the patient we have discussed uh bra would be an effective choice Speaker 3 00:28:35 Yes I think for this patient I I feel comfortable just follow my decision Speaker 2 00:28:39 Yeah Great Well um I Ill email this over to you now Uh so you have a copy your information or to use in case you need to discuss decision with the pharmacy Yeah Cool Yeah Speaker 3 00:28:58 OK Yeah No I think I think thats it Yeah Speaker 2 00:29:00 Yeah If you if you open it up Okay Yeah Ill just show you what else it can do Speaker 3 00:29:06 Yeah Speaker 2 00:29:08 Yeah If you click on um click on the graph there will take you through to med tech connect And on there you can find a lot more information Speaker 3 00:29:18 Oh laugh I didnt realize you could do that Speaker 2 00:29:21 Yeah Its a really great tool Yeah OK Um so we have looked at the uh quality of life and impact that bra has on these scores in the upper patient group Um we have also looked at the efficacy and effect on the PAI scores Youre also interested in the adverse event data which weve also discussed Um what else needs to happen for you to be able to use bra Speaker 3 00:29:48 Well I Im thinking for for the patient we identified bras a good option Um I suppose I have one nagging thought and that the the capacity to deliver the infusion we just seem to be getting busy home busier So Speaker 2 00:30:03 Yeah I do understand other doctors have expressed this too Um when you say capacity uh what is it that you mean I is it the the space or the manpower Speaker 3 00:30:13 Uh its the manpower to be honest we only have two nurses and they seem to be stacked out all the time Speaker 2 00:30:19 Yeah I did have a brief chat with Catherine week and she said she had an idea for the best way to accommodate rather than patients Um she did say that shell be available today to join us and discuss it with us Speaker 3 00:30:31 Ah yeah Shes shes off sick today unfortunately Speaker 2 00:30:34 Ah oh no Okay What shame Um I do hope she is Yeah but soon Um do you know when shell be back uh at work I mean it would be good for us to meet with Catherine to discuss her idea Speaker 3 00:30:46 Yeah I agree Uh I mean shes the one thats managing the infusions so if she thinks it can be done then Im happy Um yes I mean she should she should be back in the next week or so Speaker 2 00:30:58 Okay Well why dont we set up another call for next week and Catherine can join us if shes back Um if not we can discuss alternative ways in which we could ensure this patient is able to receive bra Speaker 3 00:31:10 OK Lets give it a go Um yeah Will you send a send me a link to the meeting like todays meeting Speaker 2 00:31:17 Yes of course I can do it now Uh what would be the best time and date for you Speaker 3 00:31:21 Um yeah well uh uh yeah probably same time again actually Wednesday 1230 Speaker 2 00:31:30 Okay Yeah So what will happen after our meeting today I will send you an email uh that will confirm the date and time and it will also contain a link that will allow you to attend the meeting

Speaker 3 00:31:54 Great great Thats fine I forward the email to Catherine when she send it Speaker 2 00:31:59 So if we sort the capacity is there anything else that happen in order to be ready for this patient to receive receive bra Speaker 3 00:32:08 Uh well as its not in the form yet uh so I need to submit forms for urgent or compassionate use Uh yeah I mean what about the uh what about the pharmacy Will they know about it and will they have stock Speaker 2 00:32:22 Yes Uh Ive spoken to pharmacy and they do have stock Uh the the hospital currently has eight patients receiving bra Speaker 3 00:32:29 Yeah Um whos been whos been doing that then Speaker 2 00:32:32 Oh Dr Kline uh has been trialing bra with great success Speaker 3 00:32:36 Oh yes Uh well that wouldnt surprise me laugh no Ill Ill go and have a a quick chat with him about it He can help me fill out the forms and we definitely need to sort out the capacity issue if were gonna be seeing a lot of new patients initiated on it Speaker 2 00:32:50 Yeah Good idea Yeah I know his team to get on get it on formula as hes seeing some great results Uh he would be able to share as a experience with you ready for when your patient is next in clinic Speaker 3 00:33:02 Well the the patients due to come back to clinic in a in a couple of weeks actually So I aim to discuss with her then to explain about a drug and administration And if shes to switch and weve sorted out the then well book a thats convenient for Speaker 2 00:33:17 Thats great news Um Ive ordered some more PO patient information leaflets get them sent directly to you Um I will follow up with you as soon as they have been sent Speaker 3 00:33:27 Okay Thats fine Speaker 2 00:33:29 Okay Im gonna make a note of that in my diary Um well its been great to see you

Louis Speaker 2 00:33:46 And and you um I will close this meeting from my end Uh you just need to close your browser um and Ill see you next Wednesday Okay Bye Speaker 3 00:33:56 Bye Speaker 0 00:34:07 Good engagement with Dr Shine through the virtual platform He gave good feedback that it worked well for him Um the objective uh to discuss the impact of severe psoriasis on the quality of life in the younger patient group and gave a in trialing patient presented the study uh specifically focusing on the 1825 cohort uh Dr Agreed that the impact on the quality of life can be very severe for his patients and impact their daily lives Um we discussed the wow study uh and the impact that a higher PAI school will have on on a patient quality of life Uh Dr Che identified a patient in which he would like to trial bra Uh we discussed the data on adverse events and he was happy with the results One area he did have a concern with was a capacity to trial in clinic The the team are extremely busy Uh I discussed that Catherine the league nurse has some ideas on how to manage this We have booked a further meeting both Dr Shine and Catherine um next week to discuss this Uh Catherine is currently off six So Ill need to check if shes back prior to our next meeting Ive agreed with Dr Shine that if she isnt back we will explore other ways in which the department can manage this uh this one patient to I also shared uh the me tech connect email This was really effective Dr Shine commented on it being useful Uh Dr Shine has agreed to touch base with Dr Klein to gain feedback on his experience using bra I will email Dr Klein to arrange for a to", "segments": "[\"Speaker 0 00:00:02 I last saw Dr Shine two months ago Uh he has more recently attended the webcast with Dr Mystery where data on the mode of action was presented for bra There has been an increase in market share in the account over the last six months The last time I saw Dr Shine um he hadnt prescribed any bra there currently eight patients on bra on the in the account My understanding is that it was um Dr Kline who initiated them based on my discussions with Catherine the nurse specialist who I saw last week there is a formulary application in process that has been initiated by Dr Kline however can be prescribed for exceptional cases or on compassionate grants Currently in this trust during previous calls um Dr Shine has said that he prefers to continue with the more established drugs that he is used to uh from previous experience Dr Speaker 0 00:01:00 Shine he he isnt an innovator when it comes to new treatments He has said in previous interactions that he is cautious when prescribing very new treatments Um mental health is on the CC agenda at the moment Um Dr Shine has previously talked about the anxiety and depression that his younger adults suffer from due to their condition I am keen to focus on this group of patients during our call today I would place uh Dr Shine as as no commitment to the product on the commitment continuum as he is not prescribed the drug And hasnt identified any suitable patients yet regarding the priority reason for choosing bra is the efficacy and data Uh I have heard the customers say um my decision at this time is to maintain the current therapy for these patients So I will be aiming for him to comment along the lines of the data you have shared with me is interesting and robust Speaker 0 00:02:04 Uh Im to use the for this interaction Uh this is the first time Ive done this with Dr Shine So Ive already sent him an ensure that he has Chrome on his computer whether or not he has access to AAM and step by step instructions on how access the remote call Ive also sent him the engage link as calendar invite and I will ensure Im on the platform 15 minutes prior to the call so that I am ready for him Um Im currently uh working at home I will make sure I have no distractions uh kids dogs uh that my environment is uh well lit Um and we can clutter I will make sure I have a glass of water and my notes to hand so that Im prepared for the full interaction Um my plan for this interaction is to discuss the impact that severe psoriasis has on the younger patient group and the impact that this has on their quality of life Speaker 0 00:03:07 And selfesteem Im keen to understand Dr Shines views on this I plan to present the data on on the efficacy of bra and gain agreement that this is this directly correlates to increased quality of life scores in this younger patient cohort By the end of the engagement I would like for Dr Shine to have a good understanding of the data and that bra could be a good choice for his younger patients with severe psoriasis and and to get him to agree to trialing it I in a patient terribly failing on our topical treatment my fullback objective will be for him to identify a way in which to recognize that rather patient when they walk through the door of the clinic within the next month as this is the first time Im engaging with Dr Shine through the BVA engage platform I I will firstly ensure that that he can see and hear me clearly Speaker 0 00:04:05 Um I will introduce myself and remind him of our previous interactions I will explore his level of comfort in using the technology for our virtual engagement focusing on his interactions with uh family uh friends work colleagues uh Ill be any technical issue He may have such as his camera being off or um sound muted I will confirm how long he has available for this interaction and outline my agenda being really clear the action I want uh aim to get from him today Its to identify younger patient where he can trial bra to begin to gain experience with it I I will also um ask if Dr has any specific topics he would like to discuss with me in the time that we have together I plan to review with Dr His views on bra and his reflections and takeaways from the webcast It will be important for me to focus the and the clinical we have specifically looking at efficacy and the benefits that has on a patients quality of life due to the or mental health and the younger patient cohort in this I Dr Speaker 0 00:05:22 S experience in this patient group uh Ill be looking for signals uh to know how comfortable uh to know he is comfortable and advise him that I will check in regularly to see what he is seeing on his screen Im keen to understand Dr Sharons views on Braddon following the webcast It will be important for me to then discuss of a patient and understand what he is looking for in the treatment for this group Uh I will use a variety of questions to gain an understanding of his needs and the areas within the data uh to present to him Um questions like um in the past uh when youve successfully changed from using Nora to how did you make that decision um and what needs to for you to be able to consider trialing bran and your patients Um what would it Speaker 1 00:06:24 Uh look like Speaker 0 00:06:25 In practice if you were to prescribe bran for your younger patients and yeah And and what have you done previously to move treatment forward when things havent gone to plan Um I could also ask how important is the impact on a on a patients mental health and selfesteem for your patients Um and also uh what Speaker 1 00:06:49 What else Speaker 0 00:06:49 Is important to him when choosing a treatment for these patients Yeah I Im aim to Speaker 1 00:06:58 Im aim here Speaker 0 00:06:59 To get Dr To reflect on on a time in the past when he has changed the newer treatments and and share the impact um this had on his patients I hope that Speaker 1 00:07:11 This will help him Speaker 0 00:07:12 See helping to see that based on the the data a change would be a good choice for his younger patients Ill be looking uh closely at his body language here to ascertain how hes really feeling What is his reaction when he reflects on making treatment changes in the past I mean how has he had a a positive reaction I will um Ill look to set up the data Im about to present uh but outlining the fact that there is some data that I think he needs to see briefly to help them make a fair and accurate decision for these patients I guess Um I guess the impact study by plaque etal is is likely to be the one most aligned to the anticipated response Dr Sh you know Dr Shine to demonstrate the benefits on the dermatology of lifes um published in the general of of uh clinical dermatology in in 2016 they asked uh 1400 patients about the impact that psoriasis had on the quality of life Speaker 0 00:08:17 And this is what they found Um in addition in the 18 to 25 year old cohort the percentage of people that uh said they had low selfesteem rose from 50 to 75 And and the percentage he said that they had really felt confident rose from 41 to 82 um also plan to use the wow uh trial to um demonstrate the legs the number of patients trial on um versus ICEP and the impact of the PASI scores Um it would be important to highlight the authority of these studies particularly the wow study published in the Lance with a large study cohort And the aim is to give him the confidence that the studies are robust and therefore bra will be a good choice for his younger patients Um I will uh intend to ask him what he thinks about the data Uh I also plan to ask him if the data is reflective of his experience I would like to challenge him if appropriate on what this data could mean for his patients Speaker 0 00:09:36 In closing I will uh summarize uh our discussion and the data Ive taken through during the engagement and check if theres any further information he requires the initial the the initial high return productive question I will use is um so what needs to happen for you to be able to prescribe to try and get him to volunteer his commitment I will explore the next steps hes going to take following our discussion I will also uh confirm my actions and time scales Um finally I will then talk Dr Off the platform and ask him for in engaging remotely what worked well for him uh and anything we can do differently next time Ill also uh send a prompt approved email and look to schedule our next call Youd Speaker 2 00:10:37 Hi Good to you again Uh I think you may be mute I I can see you but I cant I cant hear you It um if you look to the bottom of your screen youll see a microphone symbol

problem It has a bit been a bit of a steep learning curve with this um this new way of working Uh but we are we are using a really stable platform today If for any reason we were into technical difficulties Um I could talk you through some steps to resolve them if we lose connection Um youll just need to click the link in my email again Joan or you have my mobile number on there also Speaker 3 00:11:41 Okay We do Thanks Louis Speaker 2 00:11:43 Yeah So how are you last time Uh met you were you were just heading off to see daughter in her Speaker 3 00:11:53 Of course Well she was the uh the most delightful sheep Ive ever seen laugh oh Speaker 2 00:11:58 Oh how cute Speaker 3 00:12:00 Yeah indeed Although although she was quite upset that she uh that she wasnt the donkey laugh a strange child Speaker 2 00:12:08 Well theres always next year Speaker 3 00:12:10 There certainly is Speaker 2 00:12:12 Uh and how have you been faring in this current uh very strange situation Speaker 3 00:12:17 Um no not too bad Thank you Weve been juggling the uh working and and homeschooling which has been interesting Speaker 2 00:12:26 Ah yes Yeah The homeschooling I too Im feeling that pain How are you finding it Speaker 3 00:12:32 Well Whil its lovely to spend time with the children Uh I realized that Im no teacher Speaker 2 00:12:38 laugh yeah yes Me too I feel exactly the same I think uh we all have learned some new skills over the last few months Yeah Speaker 3 00:12:46 Yeah indeed Speaker 2 00:12:47 Uh and the impact on uh trust and patience Speaker 3 00:12:52 Um well were about I start seeing our patients in virtual clinics which which would be good Speaker 2 00:12:57 Itd be great for them to Im sure Yeah To contact with you Speaker 3 00:13:02 Yeah Well the feedback so far has been really good so were pleased to try and get back to to some kind of normal Speaker 2 00:13:07 Yeah Yeah I totally understand that Um so the last time we met uh we spoke about rev and you were keen to learn more about it Um you were gonna sign up to the webcast about the mode of action with Dr Mystery Uh how did how did that go Speaker 3 00:13:23 Yeah that that was a a good meeting and I appreciated the opportunity to attend the online at home as it wouldve been what it wouldve been difficult to get to a live meeting Speaker 2 00:13:32 Great Yeah Ill Ill feed that back to the office as they like to know that these things are working Um so did the webcast change how you had been thinking about bra dermatol Speaker 3 00:13:43 Uh yes And yes and no Uh I can certainly see the benefits but uh just like all these new drugs you just cant be sure of the long term safety And and that for me is uh a big hurdle to overcome Speaker 2 00:13:56 Yeah Yeah I do understand another doctors who new tore originally have said the same um bra is new and as a result theres less long term safety data than other drugs However as with all new drugs we have lots of new data being published all the time Um and Im keen uh today to take you through some of our large studies which look at safety Speaker 3 00:14:20 OK Go on Speaker 2 00:14:21 Um in all the previous conversations that weve had youve youve made it to me that priority is the patient and that you that you treat that patient as an individual and do for them Speaker 3 00:14:34 Yeah of course Speaker 2 00:14:36 Key thing weve discussed is the patients emotional mental and social wellbeing and the impact that psoriasis has on their quality of life Um I I am aware that the CCG are heavily focused on reducing the number of patients with uh depression um and anxiety currently as they recognize the impact This has on an individual in leading a fulfilling life Um looking at the data I can see that there is a higher population of younger people here than than other areas of the potentially patients who are perhaps healthier with less comorbidities where severe psoriasis is having a real impact on their selfesteem and potentially their performance Would you agree Speaker 3 00:15:24 Yeah Yeah Speaker 2 00:15:25 Uh based on this uh I would really like to focus on this patient group today specifically one or two of your patients who are currently failing on a topical treatment um someone who needs to now move to an IV option to achieve better control of their condition and where rather could be um could could be a good choice for them based on its efficacy and the resulting impact on their quality of life Speaker 3 00:15:53 Yeah Yeah I mean that that thats fine with me I see a lot of younger people Speaker 2 00:15:57 Okay Yeah Great So if I can demonstrate the benefits of bra in this patient cohort would you be willing to try it in order to gain your own experience Speaker 3 00:16:07 Uh yes Yes It would have to be a a very good argument Speaker 2 00:16:12 It it will be good for you to try it yourself so you can see the benefits for your patients Um before we go any further is there anything on your agenda that you wish to discuss with me today Speaker 3 00:16:23 Uh well I I would be interested to see any new data that you have Speaker 2 00:16:29 Um no problem Um so uh its important I have a clear picture of what you are looking for in a treatment for these patients Uh we have discussed uh that the impact on a patients mental wellbeing is a key focus for you What else is important to you when choosing a treatment for these patients Speaker 3 00:16:49 Well something that works well and and works quickly with with with minimal side effects Speaker 2 00:16:56 Tell tell me more Speaker 3 00:16:58 Well its really I patients we get it first time uh worsen of its important We minimize the impacts of this as as as quickly as we can Speaker 2 00:17:20 Yeah I completely understand that Is there anything else you wish for us to discuss today Speaker 3 00:17:26 No no no I think were good Speaker 2 00:17:28 Okay Okay Great Let me start by showing you um yeah Start by uh you through the for the dermatology life quality index DL QI uming with the gold Okay Can I can I check You can see my slides Okay Speaker 3 00:17:54 Uh yeah Yeah there is I can I can see them Speaker 2 00:17:57 Great Great If I can draw your attention to the graph on the right hand side here Im showing you yeah Im show the impact study by at uh published in the journal of clinical dermatology in 2016 um asked 1400 patients about the impact that psoriasis had on their quality of life And this is what they found now on top of these statistics in the 18 to 25 year old cohort the percentage of people that said they had low selfesteem rose from 50 to seven And the percentage you said that they rarely felt confident rose from 41 to 82 Speaker 3 00:18:41 Wow Thats a thats a big increase Speaker 2 00:18:44 Yes it is Yeah Now its one thing me sitting here showing you statistics but Im keen to hear about what you see in your practice Speaker 3 00:18:53 Uh well um I I see youngsters that uh dont go in and socialize or integrate with their peers because they they dont feel compet in in the way that they look uh quite often its the uh its the first time that theyre away from home uh from their families they feel isolated and and lonely Uh and then that then leads them to suffer from anxiety and depression Speaker 2 00:19:24 And what impact does that have on their very reason for being away from home Um their study uh Speaker 3 00:19:33 Well the theyll find it hard to sleep uh and to concentrate being um unhappy is is an emotional drain Quite often they end up moving back home which yeah Which is a shame Speaker 2 00:19:49 Must be so challenging for these patients uh in your experience what happens next for them Speaker 3 00:19:55 Well I imagine that some of them never go on to find fulltime employment and they end up feeling very isolated Speaker 2 00:20:03 So for this patient group when they come into your clinic what is the ideal outcome for them Speaker 3 00:20:10 The ideal outcome would be to reduce the amount of their body by psoriasis and also to review reduce the severity of the lesion So the patient feels more comfortable Speaker 2 00:20:22 And when they walk outta your door how do you measure your success Speaker 3 00:20:27 Oh partly for me its more about their quality of life Uh are they able to go out and integrate and live a happy fulfill life Like they should I mean that mean thats why thats why I do what I do Speaker 2 00:20:39 Yeah So if we could achieve say closer to PAI 90 and significantly improve quality of life for for this group then would you feel that it would be a success Speaker 3 00:20:51 Yes it would But all the drugs uh that do this are so expensive which is why the hospital guideline suggests systemic second line to topical Speaker 2 00:21:06 Sorry Apologies The uh the wifi seem to um seem to drop out there Can you can you hear and see me OK Speaker 3 00:21:15 Yeah Louis I I have you back now Speaker 2 00:21:18 Great Hopefully wont have more issues if we do if we do just stay on the platform um the wifi should should catch up Um sorry Back back to your point Yeah Um I understand uh that cost has got to be part of the decision Has there been a time in the past where you have prescribed a medicine off formulary Speaker 3 00:21:41 Uh yes Yes I have I have had to do that in the past Yeah Speaker 2 00:21:45 Was there a particular reason for prescribing off formulary Speaker 3 00:21:48 It came down individual what they needed at the time uh to give them the best chance of success Speaker 2 00:21:54 So if we were to narrow this younger patient group down to an Indi an individual do you have anyone in mind who fits the criteria right now Uh someone who you are looking to move to the next step whos suffering with their mental health and selfesteem due to that can do like like the like the students you mentioned earlier Speaker 3 00:22:13 Yeah Yeah I I have one person in mind Speaker 2 00:22:17 Can we concentrate on that one person then Speaker 3 00:22:20 Okay well lets lets see what you have to say Speaker 2 00:22:24 Youve mentioned systemic drugs Am I right to saying that the preferred one is yes In the past when you changed from using NORRA toe Yeah What prompted you to make that decision Speaker 3 00:22:37 Uh well thats a good question Uh well it was based on the and Speaker 2 00:22:44 If you could further improve what would you change Speaker 3 00:22:49 Well I Id certainly improve the PASI score Its good But on average we see PASI 75 at very for this patient I dont think there would be enough to improve Selfesteem Id also improve the side effects Associa with it see a nausea dizziness Speaker 2 00:23:08 Okay Um those side effects have on on the patients Speaker 3 00:23:14 Well sometimes they end up canceling the appointments for their injection and then they dont reschedule until their psoriasis is so bad that they dont have another option or sometimes occasionally theyre theyre so ill Speaker 2 00:23:29 So what would you from for me to convince you that bra is right for this patient that you have in mind Speaker 3 00:23:38 Well I would need to see that the results for this patient in terms of PAI score and quality of of life outweigh my concerns about the risk of taking a new drug Speaker 2 00:23:48 Right Well can I show you the data we have so far OK Can you see can you see my screen OK Um this slide is titled the wow trial Speaker 3 00:24:01 Yeah Yeah I can see it Speaker 2 00:24:02 Great Um there is quite a bit of info on here So Im going to draw your attention firstly to the study design as you can see this study was published in\", \"this patient in terms of PAI score and quality of of life outweigh my concerns about the risk of taking a new drug Speaker 2 00:23:48 Right Well can I show you the data we have so far OK Can you see can you see my screen OK Um this slide is titled the wow trial Speaker 3 00:24:01 Yeah Yeah I can see it Speaker 2 00:24:02 Great Um there is quite a bit of info on here So Im going to draw your attention firstly to the study design as you can see this study was published in the Lance in 2017 it was a randomized uh multicenter head to head trial comparing bra against and intercept uh total number of patients 3000 and the trial for three years Well Speaker 3 00:24:27 That thats thats a big trial for for a lot longer than I expected Speaker 2 00:24:30 Yeah And if I now draw your attention to the graph uh you can clearly see the study compared with the most commonly used Can you see uh the graph Speaker 2 00:24:44 Um you can see the next to the right of the graph that um patients in the trial had severe psoriasis defined as a Pazi level more than 15 And patients had all been on topical treatment and were at the point of needing the next step up Um they were then randomized to receive one of the three treatment arms shows the primary endpoint uh was the improvement in PA scores and the results were as follows So the the percentage of patients who achieve PASI 90 has a 90 improvement in PAI uh score on 50 mmhmm affirmative on incept 75 and on bra 90 furthermore 89 of pat 89 of patients on bra achieved PAI 90 for the four three years remaining on bra Whereas the me percentage that remained on intercept was 57 and for eight 54 So this means that the patient were focusing on is highly likely to achieve PA 90 for a four three years on bra Um how how would that impact her life do you think Speaker 3 00:26:03 Uh I mean that would have a hugely positive uh impact on on her confidence and and self esteem Speaker 2 00:26:13 And what would that allow her to do that She currently cant Speaker 3 00:26:16 Well shed be able to integrate with her peers Uh shes about noting but this this this thence to just be herself again Speaker 2 00:26:27 Yeah What would for you Speaker 3 00:26:29 Oh my aim is is to get these patients as well as possible as quickly as possible Id please Speaker 2 00:26:36 So the results look good So um lets can you see the scores here Speaker 3 00:26:47 Uh yep Yeah I can see them Speaker 2 00:26:50 Um a secondary measure in the trial was a reduction in the DQ I score from baseline And as you can see from the graph here patients Onder scored a better quality of life than for of the the other treatments and at each year And now for the other treatments you can see here that the quality of life school started to drop in response to the treatment efficacy starting to drop Whereas bra continue to be better than baseline This means that your patient will continue to feel happier and and more confident and will hope on to fulfill her So uh what you thinking now Speaker 3 00:27:31 Well Im thinking is youve Speaker 2 00:27:43 To just change the slides if you yeah If you look to the box and the center of the slide you can see yeah The re the number of adverse events that were recorded Yeah Are you with me Speaker 3 00:27:59 Yeah Yeah And were Speaker 2 00:28:01 Great So here you can see that the adverse events were significantly lower for Brava then the other treatment arms uh and and 90 of the adverse events were related to the infusion All of which were mild by nature and can be managed using premed premeds Um so so what do you think of the wow trial data overall Speaker 3 00:28:23 It looks really good Um Im impressed by the number of patients and the the length of the trial Speaker 2 00:28:29 Has this demonstrated that for the patient we have discussed uh bra would be an effective choice Speaker 3 00:28:35 Yes I think for this patient I I feel comfortable just follow my decision Speaker 2 00:28:39 Yeah Great Well um I Ill email this over to you now Uh so you have a copy your information or to use in case you need to discuss decision with the pharmacy Yeah Cool Yeah Speaker 3 00:28:58 OK Yeah No I think I think thats it Yeah Speaker 2 00:29:00 Yeah If you if you open it up Okay Yeah Ill just show you what else it can do Speaker 3 00:29:06 Yeah Speaker 2 00:29:08 Yeah If you click on um click on the graph there will take you through to med tech connect And on there you can find a lot more information Speaker 3 00:29:18 Oh laugh I didnt realize you could do that Speaker 2 00:29:21 Yeah Its a really great tool Yeah OK Um so we have looked at the uh quality of life and impact that bra has on these scores in the upper patient group Um we have also looked at the efficacy and effect on the PAI scores Youre also interested in the adverse event data which weve also discussed Um what else needs to happen for you to be able to use bra Speaker 3 00:29:48 Well I Im thinking for for the patient we identified bras a good option Um I suppose I have one nagging thought and that the the capacity to deliver the infusion we just seem to be getting busy home busier So Speaker 2 00:30:03 Yeah I do understand other doctors have expressed this too Um when you say capacity uh what is it that you mean I is it the the space or the manpower Speaker 3 00:30:13 Uh its the manpower to be honest we only have two nurses and they seem to be stacked out all the time Speaker 2 00:30:19 Yeah I did have a brief chat with Catherine week and she said she had an idea for the best way to accommodate rather than patients Um she did say that shell be available today to join us and discuss it with us Speaker 3 00:30:31 Ah yeah Shes shes off sick today unfortunately Speaker 2 00:30:34 Ah oh no Okay What shame Um I do hope she is Yeah but soon Um do you know when shell be back uh at work I mean it would be good for us to meet with Catherine to discuss her idea Speaker 3 00:30:46 Yeah I agree Uh I mean shes the one thats managing the infusions so if she thinks it can be done then Im happy Um yes I mean she should she should be back in the next week or so Speaker 2 00:30:58 Okay Well why dont we set up another call for next week and Catherine can join us if shes back Um if not we can discuss alternative ways in which we could ensure this patient is able to receive bra Speaker 3 00:31:10 OK Lets give it a go Um yeah Will you send a send me a link to the meeting like todays meeting Speaker 2 00:31:17 Yes of course I can do it now Uh what would be the best time and date for you Speaker 3 00:31:21 Um yeah well uh uh yeah probably same time again actually Wednesday 1230 Speaker 2 00:31:30

00:31:54 Great great Thats fine I forward the email to Catherine when she send it Speaker 2 00:31:59 So if we sort the capacity is there anything else that happen in order to be ready for this patient to receive receive bra Speaker 3 00:32:08 Uh well as its not in the form yet uh so I need to submit forms for urgent or compassionate use Uh yeah I mean what about the uh what about the pharmacy Will they know about it and will they have stock Speaker 2 00:32:22 Yes Uh Ive spoken to pharmacy and they do have stock Uh the the hospital currently has eight patients receiving bra Speaker 3 00:32:29 Yeah Um whos been whos been doing that then Speaker 2 00:32:32 Oh Dr Kline uh has been trialing bra with great success Speaker 3 00:32:36 Oh yes Uh well that wouldnt surprise me laugh no Ill Ill go and have a a quick chat with him about it He can help me fill out the forms and we definitely need to sort out the capacity issue if were gonna be seeing a lot of new patients initiated on it Speaker 2 00:32:50 Yeah Good idea Yeah I know his team to get on get it on formula as hes seeing some great results Uh he would be able to share as a experience with you ready for when your patient is next in clinic Speaker 3 00:33:02 Well the the patients due to come back to clinic in a in a couple of weeks actually So I aim to discuss with her then to explain about a drug and administration And if shes to switch and weve sorted out the then well book a thats convenient for Speaker 2 00:33:17 Thats great news Um Ive ordered some more PO patient information leaflets get them sent directly to you Um I will follow up with you as soon as they have been sent Speaker 3 00:33:27 Okay Thats fine Speaker 2 00:33:29 Okay Im gonna make a note of that in my diary Um well its been great to see you again and I

engagement with Dr Shine through the virtual platform He gave good feedback that it worked well for him Um the objective uh to discuss the impact of severe psoriasis on the quality of life in the younger patient group and gave a in trialing patient presented the study uh specifically focusing on the 1825 cohort uh Dr Agreed that the impact on the quality of life can be very severe for his patients and impact their daily lives Um we discussed the wow study uh and the impact that a higher PAI school will have on on a patient quality of life Uh Dr Che identified a patient in which he

busy Uh I discussed that Catherine the league nurse has some ideas on how to manage this We have booked a further meeting both Dr Shine and Catherine um next week to discuss this Uh Catherine is currently off six So Ill need to check if shes back prior to our next meeting Ive agreed with Dr Shine that if she isnt back we will explore other ways in which the department can manage this uh this

Good to see you. HCP-P Morning Dr Kinski. Good to see you too. How are you? HCP I’m good, thanks for asking, busy as always but otherwise good. HCP-P Ah, busy is a way of life these days, isn’t it? HCP It certainly is! HCP-P Well thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I know we discussed GABODERM last time we met, and we covered some of the basics, but I really believe it’s an outstanding drug that could be life changing for the right patients. Could we revisit your adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis please? I’d love you to have the confidence to want to try GABODERM in one of these patients if that is okay with you? HCP Yes, of course. HCP-P Last time we met, you mentioned that you were one of the first to try secretamab and it had become one of your routine treatments for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. HCP Yes, that’s right. HCP-P Could you tell me what was it that triggered you to try it for the first time and what did you see that made you decide to make it one of your mainstay treatments? HCP Well, let me think. I seem to remember it was one of the first new treatments we had for plaque psoriasis for years, and we’d not really had anything that effective. We had to try a whole gamut of treatments in combination to achieve any kind of significant improvement for patients, emollients, steroids, UV. So, when I saw the data for secretamab, it was outstanding and compared to what we’d experienced before, I just had to try it. From there, it lived up to my, kind of reserved expectations and I was truly amazed. It’s been a mainstay ever since. HCP-P Thank you, for sharing that. There have been other new products launched in this area since, but you don’t seem to have adopted any of those, what would a new treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis have to demonstrate for you to have that “I must try it” moment again? HCP It really has to offer something significant in terms of efficacy. Clear space between it and secretamab. HCP-P And when you say efficacy, what would that be for you? PASI 90, speed, what exactly for you? HCP With secretamab it was initially PASI 90, it was just so far out ahead of what we had at the time. Otherwise, the things I’m looking for are initial speed of action and sustained effectiveness, I don’t want it waring off in other words. HCP-P Okay, so if I want you to have that “I must try it” moment again, I need to demonstrate efficacy, PASI 90 and if possible significant improvements over current treatment. Speed of action and that it will not ware off over time. Is that correct? HCP Yes if you can do that I’ll be impressed. HCP-P Okay, I think I can, let me show you the RADIANT Study. Now, although this is a UCB sponsored study, it was peer reviewed and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2021. It was a head to head, double-blind randomised study of 743 moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients compared to secretamab, which you have been routinely using. It this okay to present? HCP Yes, it’s not very often we get new drugs compared to something we routinely use, so yes I’m very interested to see what it says. HCP-P Well, here the Y-axis shows the percentage of patients achieving PASI 90 and the X-axis shows the number of weeks of treatment. What you can see is that GABODERM moves ahead of secretamab quite early and by week 4, 34.9% of patients have achieved PASI 90 compared to just 17.5% of the secretamab group. Any comments yet? HCP Not yet, please carry on. HCP-P The separation is maintained and significant, the P-Value was less than zero point zero zero one! So, achieves really good PASI 90 and has significant superiority to secretamab, the speed of action shows separation early and is significant at week 4 and the efficacy is maintained over time as you can see. No waring off. Also, as you can see a high percentage of patients respond excellently to GABODERM. What do you think now? HCP I think. I think I probably should try it. HCP-P That’d be great. HCP So, it does raise a few questions, how do I prescribe and administer GABODERM and is there anything I need to be aware of. You know, side effects, etc. HCP-P So, ideally, we’d suggest using it in a biologic naïve patient, so you can see just how good it is and… HCP I’m not sure I’d use it for the first time in a biologic naïve patient, but I do have a couple in mind who’ve been struggling on their current biologics. HCP-P Okay, that’s great. So, how to prescribe and administer. HCP-P It’s an initial 5 doses, similar to other biologics and then switching to an 8 week interval for maintenance. Overall, it’s eight less than secretamab in the first year and less on an ongoing basis, which patients will love. HCP Well that’s easy. HCP-P It comes in a handy autoinjector, so patients can do this themselves at home, once you’ve trained them. HCP Excellent, and side effects. HCP-P Similar to the others, apart from you may see candidiasis in up to 1 in 8 patients, but it’s transient and can be treated with a simple antifungal. In the studies, we saw very few people stop treatment due to this. HCP Okay, that all seems very straight forward. HCP-P Do you have a patient in mind and how will you ensure they receive GABODERM? HCP I do have someone in mind, but I know they’re not due in for a couple of weeks. Also, although I’ll see the patient, it’ll be the nurse that administers the first dose and has responsibility for training the patient. HCP-P Well, could we book a meeting for you to meet the nurse and ensure she has everything she needs to start that patient on GABODERM? HCP Yes, let’s do that. HCP-P Excellent, also, it’s important for you to see how well GABODERM works if it’s going to become one of your routine treatments. Could, we book another meeting a couple of weeks after the patient commences treatment so we can check the patients progress? I really want you to see how fast GABODERM works. HCP DIARIES COMPLETED AND DATE AGREED Yes, let’s book that when you come in to see the nurse. HCP-P Excellent. I’ll see you then", "segments": "[\"HCP Morning, Lukas/ Birgit. Good to see you.

youre absolutely right and we need to manage these patients a lot better than we do at the moment but historically we just havent had the range of treatments needed Rep :Okay well I hope Gaboderm can answer the efficacy and side effects questions for you Let me introduce you to the DERMAB STUDY it was published in the New England Journal of Medicine It was a 5year headtohead study with adalimumab Its randomised double blind with 287 patients The results showed equivalent efficacy with fewer side effects because it is topical rather than systemic What do you think GP :That sounds impressive Are any of my colleagues using it Rep:Yes 3 GPs from the Cross surgery down the road are already using it and Dr Ali from the hospital has been referring patients out to GPs in the area GP:Thats really reassuring to hear where was the study conducted again Rep :It was across the EU GP:Mmmmm ok thats impressive Rep:So today I hope Ive answered your questions regarding efficacy and side effects to help to manage your eczema patients Will you use Gaboderm for your next eczema patient GP :Yes I think I will Rep:Brilliant What are the next steps to ensure the next patient gets Gaboderm GP:I think

bandwidth where you are isnt strong enough and hampering your signal it maybe best to turn your camera off if we lose signal for any reason you can just sign out and back in again using the Teams

Rep::I dont believe that for one second SMILING Rep::And how about you Dr Williams how have you been UPBEAT Dr W::Good thanks George it has been a very strange time but I am really pleased with how the Trust has managed the situation we are seeing some patients virtually and also some back in clinic now Rep::Thats fantastic to hear I know last time I saw you we were hearing about the Pandemic in the press but it was still a shock when we went into lockdown Dr W::Yes it was the time has gone very quickly I am amazed at how well we have all adapted John::I think we just all want to get back to some sort of normality now its great we are starting to see our patients in clinic again Rep::And how is that going John::Really well some patients are a little anxious and prefer to have a virtual appointment but we have been surprised at just how many are happy to be seen face to face in clinic Rep::Thats really great to hear how have you been finding seeing patients virtually John::Its been a challenge at times I am a bit of a technophobe so I have been on a steep learning curve EYES ROLLING Rep::So tell me do the patients respond well to the virtual clinics Dr W::Actually yes George it can be a challenge for us as whilst we see the patient on camera it is not the same as being able to read their symptoms in person we can tell so much from a patients body language and the way they behave in clinic we have to be extra vigilant Rep::Yes I can imagine it must make is more difficult for you Dr W::Yes I do find I spend more time asking the patients questions which does help to drill down to whats really going on Rep::Your patients must enjoy having the extra time with you it must be very reassuring Dr W::Yes I think you are right we are able to work at a slightly slower pace than patients backing up in clinic Rep::Thats a real bonus Rep::So it really is so brilliant to be able to see you all again today now I know we have about 30 minutes together today what I would like to do is to get some feedback on the patients that have been prescribed Ronimab in the Trust and to show you the ICS data looking at Efficacy and Tolerability We have also just had a new paper published looking at data compared to Trunimab From our discussions today I would like us to get agreement that Ronimab is a good first choice treatment for your new RA patients and those who many need to move to a different therapy due to their current treatment not working is that OK Unison::Yes yes thats fine Rep::Is there anything in particular you wish to discuss with me today John::When can we see you in person LAUGHING Rep::Hopefully not to long now I am desperate to get back out and meet you all face to face again Rep::So last time I saw you both we were waiting for NICE approval of Ronimab Dr W::Yes I see that NICE have given a positive review with guidance for use Rep::Yes we are really excited that NICE gave such a positive review and that now Ronimab can be made available to patients routinely rather than having to go through the patient access scheme :When we last spoke you applied for use for some of your patients through the scheme how did that go Dr W::It was fairly straight forward thank you for sending all of paperwork to Pharmacy Rep: :No problem at all and tell me how did the patients get on Dr W::So far so good they seem to be tolerating it well and gaining the benefit in the reduction of their symptoms Rep::It would be great to hear which types of patients you trialled it in Dr W::From recollection all were not getting the benefit from their current DMARD and were needing to add in another treatment Rep::and switching them to Ronimab helped reduce their symptoms Dr W::Yes it worked well Rep::What treatments were they on previously Dr W::Mostly Methotrexate from memory John is that correct John::Yes thats correct in fact we have been following them up in clinic and they are doing really well Rep::Thats wonderful when you say they are doing really well tell me a bit more about that John::They have all seen a relief in their symptoms and I can think of one lady in particular that was telling me how difficult lock down had been in terms of seeing her grandchildren now she is able to see them again she has been able to play with them much more easily due the reduced inflammation in her hands Rep::I love hearing these stories Ronimab really has been shown to be effective in these patients with a direct correlation in an increase in their Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life Questionnaire scores what this means is that for patients exactly like the one you described they are able to do more which is wonderful I know you have a large prevalence of RA here due to the local demographics Dr W::Yes we do Eastbourne has an aging population and with that comes more diseases in this patient group Rep::Tell me a bit more about the types of patients you see Dr W::We have a high proportion of female patients I would say the majority of our patients first present in their early 50s with tender and swollen joints Rep::What is it that pushes them to present as I am sure they may have had symptoms for a while Dr W::Yes usually it is when the pain becomes an issue and stops them from doing normal activities Rep::Are there any specific activities they become unable to do which prompts them to attend John::Its usually when their hands become so weak and painful that they cant do simple things like open a jar of coffee or struggle with doing their buttons up Rep::Gosh the impact of this on the patient must be awful do you have any patients in mind that have presented recently with these worsening of symptoms John::Yes just last week a 54 year old lady complaining that her joints were sore and swollen it was so sad as she had just been putting it down to age Rep::Thats awful to hear It must be so distressing for these patients John::Yes its always a relief to get them on treatment and start to see their symptoms improving Rep::I can well imagine what do these patients say to you once they are controlled on treatment John::They are always so grateful Rep::It must mean such a lot to the to be able to feel the benefits ultimately what does it mean for them John::Well they can just get back to having a normal life living without pain Rep::Thats so powerful isnt it living without pain and able to get back to normal life something most of us take for granted John::yes it really is Rep::so what did you prescribe for this patient John::Dr W I think you opted for Trunimab Dr W::Yes thats right Rep::Was there any particular reason you chose Trunimab for this patient Dr W::Well it is usually our first choice it works well and has a good side effect profile Rep::When you say works well what do you mean Dr W::Well patients get good symptom relief after the first six weeks or so Rep::Thats great to hear So keep this sort of patient in mind and as I said earlier what Id like to do is work toward agreeing that Ronimab will benefit these patients as a firstchoice treatment What would be most helpful for you to hear from me today that would help you understand the benefits of doing this Dr W::Well it would be good if you could remind us of the data You mentioned that you had data compared to Trunimab That would be useful to see Rep::Of course So if I go through the ICS data which covers the efficacy and tolerability data for Ronimab and demonstrates that its a once a month treatment with a good side effect profile at the site of injection and then the comparative data with Trunimab thats sounds like it would be helpful understanding why Ronimab is a great choice for these patientsIs that OK Dr W::Yes of course REP::OK this seems like a good time to share my screen so bear with me :Right can I ask what you see on your screen SHARES SLIDES ON SCREEN John::We can see a slide with Ronimab on it Rep::Brilliant right now to start with I just want to show you a quick animation on the Mode of Action and why Ronimab is different to the other Biologics you are using can you see the running animation John::Yes we can Rep::Great so as you can see here Ronimab is different to other IL inhibitors in that it works by inhibiting IL14 John::I like the animation it makes it really clear Rep::Yes our marketing team are pretty proud of this one its a real help as it can be complicated to explain do any of you have any questions on this page Dr W::No you can carry on George Rep::Great right so I am just going to change my slides to the ICS Trial can you all see that OK Unison::Yes Rep: :So this is the pivotal study by Professor Murray you can see here that it was published in the Lancet in 2020 the study looked at the Efficacy and safety of Ronimab as monotherapy in patients with Rheumatoid arthritis for whom previous disease modifying antirheumatic drug treatment had failed If I draw your attention to the study design here in this box on the top right you can see that that there were 328 patients enrolled in the study and the mean age was 647 years and 71 were female This was a 32week double blind placebo controlled phase III trial Patients were randomised to receive Ronimab 40mg once a month Placebo once a month The primary endpoint was the 20 improvement in the ACR core criteria The Secondary endpoint looked at side effects at the injection site Any questions on the study design John::No we are good thanks Rep::OK Great so now I am going to draw your attention to this graph on the righthand side I am hovering over it with my cursor here you can see the results in that patients treated with Ronimab had significantly better response rates than placebo remember these patients had previously failed on a DMARD You can see that there were no significant differences found between Ronimab and Placebo treated patients for serious adverse events serious infections or malignancies :You can see that here in the conclusion Among patients with RA for whom previous DMARD treatment had failed Ronimab monotherapy achieved significant rapid and sustained improvements in disease activity and improved physical function and was safe and well tolerated What are your thoughts Dr Williams I will come to you first Dr W::This looks good George and we did see this reflected in the patients we trialled it in Rep::Thats really great to hear I mean the data is very impressive but for me its what it actually means to the patient as we talked about earlier the ability to do more simple daily activities giving them back their freedom John what are your thoughts on this data John::Well it would be us as a nurse team who tend to pick up when a patient needs to switch or have an additional treatment added to their Methotrexate Its really important for me that when make the right choice for the right patient their symptoms may have been worsening for some time but they put that down to general disease progression its important to us that we get them on something that will help lessen their symptoms as soon as possible Rep::So thinking about the patient we discussed earlier does this data help show why Ronimab could be a good choice John::What about the data you mentioned comparing to Tunimab Rep::I am really glad you asked this John I am just going to stop sharing my screen for a moment STOPS SHARING SCREEN :Ah there you all are I find it a bit of a pain that I cant see you all when I have my slides up thats better so can I ask you all what it is you like about Trunimab John::SMILES yes its much nicer to talk when we can see you Well patients do really seem to do on well on it particularly when their initial DMARD has failed Its simple and easy for the patients to take we like that its one injection once every two weeks Rep::Is that important to your patients having to only inject biweekly John::Yes no one really likes having to inject themselves and this was a bit of a game changer when Trunimab was made available Rep::In what way John::I think they just prefer that its easier to use Rep::So that fact that Ronimab is once a month could also be a real game changer for these patients John::Oh yes we are really pleased about this our patients will be too Rep::Am I correct in thinking that Lottomab was your treatment of choice before Trunimab was launched John::Yes patients did well on Lottomab too and we still use it on occasion its a good second choice Rep::Its really great to have choices for these patients In the past when you changed from using Lottomab to Trunimab how did you come to make that decision John::Well the data did look better for Trunimab and patients do tend to see less pain and inflammation at the injection site when using Trunimab Rep::Yes I have heard that in previous discussions with your colleagues and Dr Williams what are your thoughts here Dr W::I tend to agree with John Lottomab did quite often produce some fairly nasty side effects at the injection site oozing and swelling etc Rep::Yes I have heard this a lot too it cant be pleasant for the patients so a treatment that has minimal side effects at the injection site is also important to you Unison::Oh yes Dr W::This is an important consideration for our patients Rep::Ok so If I can show you that Ronimab has good efficacy data when compared to Trunimab and a low incidence of side effects at the injection site would this mean you would consider using Ronimab more routinely for these patients Dr W::Yes I guess so lets see the data Rep::Let me bring up my slides again here we go can you see them SHARES SLIDES Dr W::Yes we can see them Rep::OK so lets firstly start with the Injection site side effects as this is clearly important to you and your patients lets go back to the ICS data can you see this on the screen Dr W::Yes Rep::OK so here you can see the secondary endpoint was looking at the side effects at the injection site you can see here that when compared to placebo the side effects were very comparable no increased oozing at the injection site John::This is really good George Rep::This means that the patients are not going to get any nasty side effects from injecting Ronimab as you already said its not nice to have to be having injections and this really is another huge positive for Ronimab :So lets now have a quick look at the RAPID Data I have just changed the slides on my screen can you see the RAPID data John::Yes we can thanks Rep: :OK so as we know to date headtohead trials comparing the efficacy and safety of biological diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs within the same class including TNF inhibitors in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy are lacking So we are really pleased to present the following data now the RAPID study was published in the BMJ earlier this year The RAPID study design was to compare over 2 years the safety efficacy and radiographic outcomes of subcutaneous Ronimab versus Trunimab in combination with methotrexate MTX in patients with rheumatoid arthritis RA :Now let me draw your attention to the Study design on the slides here on the left can you see it John::Yes Rep::OK so the study was a randomised investigator blinded study with a 1year primary endpoint look at response rates :536 patients were randomised with across the two arms of the study Now if I draw your attention here to the results you can see that in terms of efficacy there was no significant difference this means that for your patients by being given Ronimab they can have similar efficacy to Trunimab but with a better side effect profile at the site of injection and to top it all off Ronimab is only injected once a month Let me stop sharing my screen so I can see you all STOPS SHARING SCREEN Rep::So what are your thoughts on this data Dr W::It looks very impressive George particularly the need for just one monthly injection Rep::So what needs to happen for you to be able to consider continuing to use Ronimab in your RA patients Dr W::well my understanding is Ronimab is far more expensive when compared to Trunimab Rep::I totally understand that cost is important to you its a very important consideration however when you say expensive do you mean: Dr W::well its more expensive isnt it Rep::Yes you are right however as Trunimab is a bi weekly injection by using Ronimab you can reduce the amount of times the patients needs to come into clinic to have their injection by 50 Therefore reducing the overall costs for the Trust What would be great is if I can arrange for our Market Access manager to come and see you he has a whizzy budget impact model that he can plug in the Trust data and give you projections for any costs and indeed savings that could be made for the Trust Dr W::That would be good Rep::And dont forget we have positive NICE approval meaning they feel the treatment is cost effective Dr W::Yes there is that Rep: :So if we were to demonstrate that there are no increased costs associated with using Ronimab is there anything else that could prevent us progressing to a formulary application Dr W::I dont see why not Rep::OK let me set that appointment up with My Market Access Manager for you would it be useful for you all to see him John::Yes I would be keen although ultimately it will be Dr Williams decision Rep::why dont we book it for your next weekly meeting that way the data is still fresh in your mind Dr W::That works for me next week same time John John::Yes that works for me Rep::Great My Market Access Manager is called Ron I will set this up with him straight after we finish so do look out for his invitation Rep::Would you like for me to send you the Formulary application pack too Dr W::Yes that would be useful to look through Rep::OK will do would it be worth my having a chat with Pharmacy prior to next weeks call Dr W::Thats OK George we have a Department meeting coming up with the pharmacy team in attendance so I will bring this up with them Rep::Brilliant Rep::So to summarise today we have looked at the ICS data looking at the efficacy and tolerability of Ronimab we have also looked at the second endpoint of which outlines that the incidence of side effects at the injection site it comparable to placebo :We have also looked at the RAPID data comparing Ronimab to Tunimab and the benefits of a once monthly injection :So lets go back to those patients we were talking about earlier where the current treatment isnt providing the symptom relief that they want and that is impacting on their ability to go about their normal life what next steps would you like to take to make Ronimab the first choice options for these type of patients Dr W: :Well I think now that Ive got the confidence to continue to put new patients on it whilst we look at formulary inclusion Rep::Thats great How will you identify those suitable patients Dr W: :Well I think I can continue to do that at the new patient clinic Maybe there are some existing patients we need to discuss John John::Yes we could do that Rep:Thats great And what would you like to do next to move towards Formulary inclusion How can I support you Dr W::I think having the cost projections you mentioned along side the data would help with getting it on formulary Rep::Of course As I mentioned I will get our Market Access Manager to get in touch and once you have seen Ron and have the numbers can I book in another appointment for us to discuss the progression to formulary inclusion provided the numbers look good Dr W::SMILING Yes George that seems like a good next step please email me and we can book it in Rep::Great before I finish is there anything else you wish to discuss with me today Dr W::No thanks George its been good to see you Rep::Its been really wonderful to see you all too I have enjoyed being able to catch up with you all Can I ask if you have any feedback on our virtual engagement today John::Its been great to see you George hopefully not too long until we can see you in person Rep::I would love that John its been really great to see you both again :Now to close our session you just need to click on the leave meeting

that have presented recently with these worsening of symptoms John::Yes just last week a 54 year old lady complaining that her joints were sore and swollen it was so sad as she had just been putting it down to age Rep::Thats awful to hear It must be so distressing for these patients John::Yes its always a relief to get them on treatment and start to see their symptoms improving Rep::I can well imagine what do these patients say to you once they are controlled on treatment John::They are always so grateful Rep::It must mean such a lot to the to be able to feel the benefits ultimately what does it mean for them John::Well they can just get back to having a normal life living without pain Rep::Thats so powerful isnt it living without pain and able to get back to normal life something most of us take for granted John::yes it really is Rep::so what did you prescribe for this patient John::Dr W I think you opted for Trunimab Dr W::Yes thats right Rep::Was there any particular reason you chose Trunimab for this patient Dr W::Well it is usually our first choice it works well and has a good side effect profile Rep::When you say works well what do you mean Dr W::Well patients get good symptom relief after the first six weeks or so Rep::Thats great to hear So keep this sort of patient in mind and as I said earlier what Id like to do is work toward agreeing that Ronimab will benefit these patients as a firstchoice treatment What would be most helpful for you to hear from me today that would help you understand the benefits of doing this Dr W::Well it would be good if you could remind us of the data You mentioned that you had data compared to Trunimab That would be useful to see Rep::Of course So if I go through the ICS data which covers the efficacy and tolerability data for Ronimab and demonstrates that its a once a month treatment with a good side effect profile at the site of injection and then the comparative data with Trunimab thats sounds like it would be helpful understanding why Ronimab is a great choice for these patientsIs that OK Dr W::Yes of course REP::OK this seems like a good time to share my screen so bear with me :Right can I ask what you see on your screen SHARES SLIDES ON SCREEN John::We can see a slide with Ronimab on it Rep::Brilliant right now to start with I just want to show you a quick animation on the Mode of Action and why Ronimab is different to the other Biologics you are using can you see the running animation John::Yes we can Rep::Great so as you can see here Ronimab is different to other IL inhibitors in that it works by inhibiting IL14 John::I like the animation it makes it really clear Rep::Yes our marketing team are pretty proud of this one its a real help as it can be complicated to explain do any of you have any questions on this page Dr W::No you can carry on George Rep::Great right so I am just going to change my slides to the ICS Trial can you all see that OK Unison::Yes Rep: :So this is the pivotal study by Professor Murray you can see here that it was published in the Lancet in 2020 the study looked at the Efficacy and safety of Ronimab as monotherapy in patients with Rheumatoid arthritis for whom previous disease modifying antirheumatic drug treatment had failed If I draw your attention to the study design here in this box on the top right you can see that that there were 328 patients enrolled in the study and the mean age was 647 years and 71 were female This was a 32week double blind placebo controlled phase III trial Patients were randomised to receive Ronimab 40mg once a month Placebo once a month The primary endpoint was the 20 improvement in the ACR core criteria The Secondary endpoint looked at side effects at the injection site Any questions on the study design John::No we are good thanks Rep::OK Great so now I am going to draw your attention to this graph on the righthand side I am hovering over it with my cursor here you can see the results in that patients treated with Ronimab had significantly better response rates than placebo remember these patients had previously failed on a DMARD You can see that there were no significant differences found between Ronimab and Placebo treated patients for serious adverse events serious infections or malignancies :You can see that here in the conclusion Among patients with RA for whom previous DMARD treatment had failed Ronimab monotherapy achieved significant rapid and sustained improvements in disease activity and improved physical function and was safe and well tolerated What are your thoughts Dr Williams I will come to you first Dr W::This looks good George and we did see this reflected in the patients we trialled it in Rep::Thats really great to hear I mean the data is very impressive but for me its what it actually means to the patient as we talked about earlier the ability to do more simple daily activities giving them back their freedom John what are your thoughts on this data John::Well it would be us as a nurse team who tend to pick up when a patient needs to switch or have an additional treatment added to their Methotrexate Its really important for me that when make the right choice for the right patient their symptoms may have been worsening for some time but they put that down to general disease progression its important to us that we get them on something that will help lessen their symptoms as soon as possible Rep::So thinking about the patient we discussed earlier does this data help show why Ronimab could be a good choice John::What about the data you mentioned comparing to Tunimab Rep::I am really glad you asked this John I am just going to stop sharing my screen for a moment STOPS SHARING SCREEN :Ah there you all are I find it a bit of a pain that I cant see you all when I have my slides up thats better so can I ask you all what it is you like about Trunimab John::SMILES yes its much nicer to talk when we can see you Well patients do really seem to do on well on it particularly when their initial DMARD has failed Its simple and easy for the patients to take we like that its one injection once every two weeks Rep::Is that important to your patients having to only inject biweekly John::Yes no one really likes having to inject themselves and this was a bit of a game changer when Trunimab was made available Rep::In what way John::I think they just prefer that its easier to use Rep::So that fact that Ronimab is once a month could also be a real game changer for these patients John::Oh yes we are really pleased about this our patients will be too Rep::Am I correct in thinking that Lottomab was your treatment of choice before Trunimab was launched John::Yes patients did well on Lottomab too and we still use it on occasion its a good second choice Rep::Its really great to have choices for these patients In the past when you changed from using Lottomab to Trunimab how did you come to make that decision John::Well the data did look better for Trunimab and patients do tend to see less pain and inflammation at the injection site when using Trunimab Rep::Yes I have heard that in previous discussions with your colleagues and Dr Williams what are your thoughts here Dr W::I tend to agree with John Lottomab did quite often produce some fairly nasty side effects at the injection site oozing and swelling etc Rep::Yes I have heard this a lot too it cant be pleasant for the patients so a treatment that has minimal side effects at the injection site is also important to you Unison::Oh yes Dr W::This is an important consideration for our patients Rep::Ok so If I can show you that Ronimab has good efficacy data when compared to Trunimab and a low incidence of side effects at the injection site would this mean you would consider using Ronimab more routinely for these patients Dr W::Yes I guess so lets see the data Rep::Let me bring up my slides again here we go can you see them SHARES SLIDES Dr W::Yes we can see them Rep::OK so lets firstly start with the Injection site side effects as this is clearly important to you and your patients lets go back to the ICS data can you see this on the screen Dr W::Yes Rep::OK so here you can see the secondary endpoint was looking at the side effects at the injection site you can see here that when compared to placebo the side effects were very comparable no increased oozing at the injection site John::This is really good George Rep::This means that the patients are not going to get any nasty side effects from injecting Ronimab as you already said its not nice to have to be having injections and this really is another huge positive for Ronimab :So lets now have a quick look at the RAPID Data I have just changed the slides on my screen can you see the RAPID data John::Yes we can thanks Rep: :OK so as we know to date headtohead trials comparing the efficacy and safety of biological diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs within the same class including TNF inhibitors in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy are lacking So we are really pleased to present the following data now the RAPID study was published in the BMJ earlier this year The RAPID study design was to compare over 2 years the safety efficacy and radiographic outcomes of subcutaneous Ronimab versus Trunimab in combination with methotrexate MTX in patients with rheumatoid arthritis RA :Now let me draw your attention to the Study design on the slides here on the left can you see it John::Yes Rep::OK so the study was a randomised investigator blinded study with a 1year primary endpoint look at response rates :536 patients were randomised with across the two arms of the study Now if I draw your attention here to the results you can see that in terms of efficacy there was no significant difference this means that for your patients by being given Ronimab they can have similar efficacy to Trunimab but with a better side effect profile at the site of injection and to top it all off Ronimab is only injected once a month Let me stop sharing my screen so I can see you all STOPS SHARING SCREEN Rep::So what are your thoughts on this data Dr W::It looks very impressive George particularly the need for just one monthly injection Rep::So what needs to happen for you to be able to consider continuing to use Ronimab in your RA patients Dr W::well my understanding is Ronimab is far more expensive when compared to Trunimab Rep::I totally understand that cost is important to you its a very important consideration however when you say expensive do you mean: Dr W::well its more expensive isnt it Rep::Yes you are right however as Trunimab is a bi weekly injection by using Ronimab you can reduce the amount of times the patients needs to come into clinic to have their injection by 50 Therefore reducing the overall costs for the Trust What would be great is if I can arrange for our Market Access manager to come and see you he has a whizzy budget impact model that he can plug in the Trust data and give you projections for any costs and indeed savings that could be made for the Trust Dr W::That would be good Rep::And dont forget we have positive NICE approval meaning they feel the treatment is cost effective Dr W::Yes there is that Rep: :So if we were to demonstrate that there are no increased costs associated with using Ronimab is there anything else that could prevent us progressing to a formulary application Dr W::I dont see why not Rep::OK let me set that appointment up with My Market Access Manager for you would it be useful for you all to see him John::Yes I would be keen although ultimately it will be Dr Williams decision Rep::why dont we book it for your next weekly meeting that way the data is still fresh in your mind Dr W::That works for me next week same time John John::Yes that works for me Rep::Great My Market Access Manager is called Ron I will set this up with him straight after we finish so do look out for his invitation Rep::Would you like for me to send you the Formulary application pack too Dr W::Yes that would be useful to look through Rep::OK will do would it be worth my having a chat with Pharmacy prior to next weeks call Dr W::Thats OK George we have a Department meeting coming up with the pharmacy team in attendance so I will bring this up with them Rep::Brilliant Rep::So to summarise today we have looked at the ICS data looking at the efficacy and tolerability of Ronimab we have also looked at the second endpoint of which outlines that the incidence of side effects at the injection site it comparable to placebo :We have also looked at the RAPID data comparing Ronimab to Tunimab and the benefits of a once monthly injection :So lets go back to those patients we were talking about earlier where the current treatment isnt providing the symptom relief that they want and that is impacting on their ability to go about their normal life what next steps would you like to take to make Ronimab the first choice options for these type of patients Dr W: :Well I think now that Ive got the confidence to continue to put new patients on it whilst we look at formulary inclusion Rep::Thats great How will you identify those suitable patients Dr W: :Well I think I can continue to do that at the new patient clinic Maybe there are some existing patients we need to discuss John John::Yes we could do that Rep:Thats great And what would you like to do next to move towards Formulary inclusion How can I support you Dr W::I think having the cost projections you mentioned along side the data would help with getting it on formulary Rep::Of course As I mentioned I will get our Market Access Manager to get in touch and once you have seen Ron and have the numbers can I book in another appointment for us to discuss the progression to formulary inclusion provided the numbers look good Dr W::SMILING Yes George that seems like a good next step please email me and we can book it in Rep::Great before I finish is there anything else you wish to discuss with me today Dr W::No thanks George its been good to see you Rep::Its been really wonderful to see you all too

before I go into that I just wanted to do a little bit more of a background to the lab So with your instrument setup at the moment what instruments do you have in immunology at the moment HCP:In immunology obviously weve got the Optimed 360 just the one of those RE:So with the CCPs Tracey whats your workload at the moment How many are you doing a day roughly HCP:A day Gosh I think current workload is about 250 a month that were sending away RE:And so youre sending them away to Partridge at the moment and what analyser do they run them on HCP:Theyre using the Biovance automated system so they just pop them on and theyre tracked and the turnaround times are really rapid which is fantastic RE:So in terms of bringing them back in house then in a perfect world how would you like to see the service setup for your CCPs here How would you like to run them do you think HCP:I think the main plan is because we also have automation downstairs there is the Biovance tracking system and

are you running that every day HCP:Yes most days RE:And how often do you run the EliA IgG method HCP:Thats pretty much every day for a variety of tests RE:So what would you say then if we could look at say for example running your CCPs three times a day Because am I right in thinking that CCP testing its not classed as urgent per se HCP:No thats why its got quite a generous turnaround time compared to MPA PR3s and things like that RE:With it being continuous loading we could have the EliA IgG method set up every day and maybe you could prioritise three days but know that youve got the

week for CCPs you would be within your turnaround time HCP:Okay yes If you could forward that on thatd be really handy please RE:Yes So does that sounds like something that would work in terms of doing CCP three times a day do you think that would fit HCP:Yes I think at this stage depending on costs etc its worth thinking about definitely RE:And then what would be involved in that Tracey in terms of if you wanted to consider looking at them on the Optimed 360 HCP:Well obviously you know weve never got enough staff and theres never enough time is there any way you could give us some

Good to see you. HCP-P Morning Dr Kinski. Good to see you too. How are you? HCP I’m good, thanks for asking, busy as always but otherwise good. HCP-P Ah, busy is a way of life these days, isn’t it? HCP It certainly is! HCP-P Well thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I know we discussed GABODERM last time we met, and we covered some of the basics, but I really believe it’s an outstanding drug that could be life changing for the right patients. Could we revisit your adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis please? I’d love you to have the confidence to want to try GABODERM in one of these patients if that is okay with you? HCP Yes, of course. HCP-P Last time we met, you mentioned that you were one of the first to try secretamab and it had become one of your routine treatments for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. HCP Yes, that’s right. HCP-P Could you tell me what was it that triggered you to try it for the first time and what did you see that made you decide to make it one of your mainstay treatments? HCP Well, let me think. I seem to remember it was one of the first new treatments we had for plaque psoriasis for years, and we’d not really had anything that effective. We had to try a whole gamut of treatments in combination to achieve any kind of significant improvement for patients, emollients, steroids, UV. So, when I saw the data for secretamab, it was outstanding and compared to what we’d experienced before, I just had to try it. From there, it lived up to my, kind of reserved expectations and I was truly amazed. It’s been a mainstay ever since. HCP-P Thank you, for sharing that. There have been other new products launched in this area since, but you don’t seem to have adopted any of those, what would a new treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis have to demonstrate for you to have that “I must try it” moment again? HCP It really has to offer something significant in terms of efficacy. Clear space between it and secretamab. HCP-P And when you say efficacy, what would that be for you? PASI 90, speed, what exactly for you? HCP With secretamab it was initially PASI 90, it was just so far out ahead of what we had at the time. Otherwise, the things I’m looking for are initial speed of action and sustained effectiveness, I don’t want it waring off in other words. HCP-P Okay, so if I want you to have that “I must try it” moment again, I need to demonstrate efficacy, PASI 90 and if possible significant improvements over current treatment. Speed of action and that it will not ware off over time. Is that correct? HCP Yes if you can do that I’ll be impressed. HCP-P Okay, I think I can, let me show you the RADIANT Study. Now, although this is a UCB sponsored study, it was peer reviewed and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2021. It was a head to head, double-blind randomised study of 743 moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients compared to secretamab, which you have been routinely using. It this okay to present? HCP Yes, it’s not very often we get new drugs compared to something we routinely use, so yes I’m very interested to see what it says. HCP-P Well, here the Y-axis shows the percentage of patients achieving PASI 90 and the X-axis shows the number of weeks of treatment. What you can see is that GABODERM moves ahead of secretamab quite early and by week 4, 34.9% of patients have achieved PASI 90 compared to just 17.5% of the secretamab group. Any comments yet? HCP Not yet, please carry on. HCP-P The separation is maintained and significant, the P-Value was less than zero point zero zero one! So, achieves really good PASI 90 and has significant superiority to secretamab, the speed of action shows separation early and is significant at week 4 and the efficacy is maintained over time as you can see. No waring off. Also, as you can see a high percentage of patients respond excellently to GABODERM. What do you think now? HCP I think. I think I probably should try it. HCP-P That’d be great. HCP So, it does raise a few questions, how do I prescribe and administer GABODERM and is there anything I need to be aware of. You know, side effects, etc. HCP-P So, ideally, we’d suggest using it in a biologic naïve patient, so you can see just how good it is and… HCP I’m not sure I’d use it for the first time in a biologic naïve patient, but I do have a couple in mind who’ve been struggling on their current biologics. HCP-P Okay, that’s great. So, how to prescribe and administer. HCP-P It’s an initial 5 doses, similar to other biologics and then switching to an 8 week interval for maintenance. Overall, it’s eight less than secretamab in the first year and less on an ongoing basis, which patients will love. HCP Well that’s easy. HCP-P It comes in a handy autoinjector, so patients can do this themselves at home, once you’ve trained them. HCP Excellent, and side effects. HCP-P Similar to the others, apart from you may see candidiasis in up to 1 in 8 patients, but it’s transient and can be treated with a simple antifungal. In the studies, we saw very few people stop treatment due to this. HCP Okay, that all seems very straight forward. HCP-P Do you have a patient in mind and how will you ensure they receive GABODERM? HCP I do have someone in mind, but I know they’re not due in for a couple of weeks. Also, although I’ll see the patient, it’ll be the nurse that administers the first dose and has responsibility for training the patient. HCP-P Well, could we book a meeting for you to meet the nurse and ensure she has everything she needs to start that patient on GABODERM? HCP Yes, let’s do that. HCP-P Excellent, also, it’s important for you to see how well GABODERM works if it’s going to become one of your routine treatments. Could, we book another meeting a couple of weeks after the patient commences treatment so we can check the patients progress? I really want you to see how fast GABODERM works. HCP DIARIES COMPLETED AND DATE AGREED Yes, let’s book that when you come in to see the nurse. HCP-P Excellent. I’ll see you then", "segments": "[\"HCP Morning, Lukas/ Birgit. Good to see you.

What you can see is that GABODERM moves ahead of secretamab quite early and by week 4, 34.9% of patients have achieved PASI 90 compared to just 17.5% of the secretamab group. Any comments yet? HCP Not yet, please carry on. HCP-P The separation is maintained and significant, the P-Value was less than zero point zero zero one! So, achieves really good PASI 90 and has significant superiority to secretamab, the speed of action shows separation early and is significant at week 4 and the efficacy is maintained over time as you can see. No waring off. Also, as you can see a high percentage of patients respond excellently to GABODERM. What do you think now? HCP I think. I think I probably should try it. HCP-P That\\u2019d be great. HCP So, it does raise a few questions, how do I prescribe and administer GABODERM and is there anything I need to be aware of. You know, side effects, etc. HCP-P So, ideally, we\\u2019d suggest using it in a biologic na\\u00efve patient, so you can see just how good it is and\\u2026 HCP I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019d use it for the first time in a biologic na\\u00efve patient, but I do have a couple in mind who\\u2019ve been struggling on their current biologics. HCP-P Okay, that\\u2019s great. So, how to prescribe and administer. HCP-P It\\u2019s an initial 5 doses, similar to other biologics and then switching to an 8 week interval for maintenance. Overall, it\\u2019s eight less than secretamab in the first year and less on an ongoing basis, which patients will love. HCP Well that\\u2019s easy. HCP-P It comes in a handy autoinjector, so patients can do this themselves at home, once you\\u2019ve trained them. HCP Excellent, and side effects. HCP-P Similar to the others, apart from you may see candidiasis in up to 1 in 8 patients, but it\\u2019s transient and can be treated with a simple antifungal. In the studies, we saw very few people stop treatment due to this. HCP Okay, that all seems very straight forward. HCP-P Do you have a patient in mind and how will you ensure they receive GABODERM? HCP I do have someone in mind, but I know they\\u2019re not due in for a couple of weeks. Also, although I\\u2019ll see the patient, it\\u2019ll be the nurse that administers the first dose and has responsibility for training the patient. HCP-P Well, could we book a meeting for you to meet the nurse and ensure she has everything she needs to start that patient on GABODERM? HCP Yes, let\\u2019s do that. HCP-P Excellent, also, it\\u2019s important for you to see how well GABODERM works if it\\u2019s going to become one of your routine treatments. Could, we book another meeting a couple of weeks after the patient commences treatment so we can check the patients progress? I really want you to see how fast GABODERM works. HCP DIARIES COMPLETED AND DATE AGREED Yes, let\\u2019s book that when you come in to see the nurse. HCP-P Excellent. I\\u2019ll see you then\"]", "docker_feteched": true, "created_at": "2024-06-11T07:45:14.029Z"}}, {"model": "analysis.transcription", "pk": 59, "fields": {"text": "Rep :Thank you for seeing me GP

today I know we discussed GABODERM last time we met and we covered some of the basics but I really believe its an outstanding drug that could be life changing for the right patients Could we revisit your adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis please Id love you to have the confidence to want to try GABODERM in one of these patients if that is okay with you HCP Yes of course HCPP Last time we met you mentioned that you were one of the first to try secretamab and it had become one of your routine treatments for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis HCP Yes thats right HCPP Could you tell me what was it that triggered you to try it for the first time and what did you see that made you decide to make it one of your mainstay treatments HCP Well let me think I seem to remember it was one of the first new treatments we had for plaque psoriasis for years and wed not really had anything that effective We had to try a whole gamut of treatments in combination to achieve any kind of significant improvement for patients emollients steroids UV So when I saw the data for secretamab it was outstanding and compared to what wed experienced before I just had to try it From there it lived up to my kind of reserved expectations and I was truly amazed Its been a mainstay ever since HCPP Thank you for sharing that There have been other new products launched in this area since but you dont seem to have adopted any of those what would a new treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis have to demonstrate for you to have that I must try it moment again HCP It really has to offer something significant in terms of efficacy Clear space between it and secretamab HCPP And when you say efficacy what would that be for you PASI 90 speed what exactly for you HCP With secretamab it was initially PASI 90 it was just so far out ahead of what we had at the time Otherwise the things Im looking for are initial speed of action and sustained effectiveness I dont want it waring off in other words HCPP Okay so if I want you to have that I must try it moment again I need to demonstrate efficacy PASI 90 and if possible significant improvements over current treatment Speed of action and that it will not ware off over time Is that correct HCP Yes if you can do that Ill be impressed HCPP Okay I think I can let me show you the RADIANT Study Now although this is a UCB sponsored study it was peer reviewed and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2021 It was a head to head doubleblind randomised study of 743 moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients compared to secretamab which you have been routinely using It this okay to present HCP Yes its not very often we get new drugs compared to something we routinely use so yes Im very interested to see what it says HCPP Well here the Yaxis shows the percentage of patients achieving PASI 90 and the Xaxis shows the number of weeks of treatment What you can see is that GABODERM moves ahead of secretamab quite early and by week 4 349 of patients have achieved PASI 90 compared to just 175 of the secretamab group Any comments yet HCP Not yet please carry on HCPP The separation is maintained and significant the PValue was less than zero point zero zero one So achieves really good PASI 90 and has significant superiority to secretamab the speed of action shows separation early and is significant at week 4 and the efficacy is maintained over time as you can see No waring off Also as you can see a high percentage of patients respond excellently to GABODERM What do you think now HCP I think I think I probably should try it HCPP Thatd be great HCP So it does raise a few questions how do I prescribe and administer GABODERM and is there anything I need to be aware of You know side effects etc HCPP So ideally wed suggest using it in a biologic nave patient so you can see just how good it is and HCP Im not sure Id use it for the first time in a biologic nave patient but I do have a couple in mind whove been struggling on their current biologics HCPP Okay thats great So how to prescribe and administer HCPP Its an initial 5 doses similar to other biologics and then switching to an 8 week interval for maintenance Overall its eight less than secretamab in the first year and less on an ongoing basis which patients will love HCP Well thats easy HCPP It comes in a handy autoinjector so patients can do this themselves at home once youve trained them HCP Excellent and side effects HCPP Similar to the others apart from you may see candidiasis in up to 1 in 8 patients but its transient

steroids UV So when I saw the data for secretamab it was outstanding and compared to what wed experienced before I just had to try it From there it lived up to my kind of reserved expectations and I was truly amazed Its been a mainstay ever since HCPP Thank you for sharing that There have been other new products launched in this area since but you dont seem to have adopted any of those what would a new treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis have to demonstrate for you to have that I must try it moment again HCP It really has to offer something significant in terms of efficacy Clear space between it and secretamab HCPP And when you say efficacy what would that be for you PASI 90 speed what exactly for you HCP With secretamab it was initially PASI 90 it was just so far out ahead of what we had at the time Otherwise the things Im looking for are initial speed of action and sustained effectiveness I dont want it waring off in other words HCPP Okay so if I want you to have that I must try it moment again I need to demonstrate efficacy PASI 90 and if possible significant improvements over current treatment Speed of action and that it will not ware off over time Is that correct HCP Yes if you can do that Ill be impressed HCPP Okay I think I can let me show you the RADIANT Study Now although this is a UCB sponsored study it was peer reviewed and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2021 It was a head to head doubleblind randomised study of 743 moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients compared to secretamab which you have been routinely using It this okay to present HCP Yes its not very often we get new drugs compared to something we routinely use so yes Im very interested to see what it says HCPP Well here the Yaxis shows the percentage of patients achieving PASI 90 and the Xaxis shows the number of weeks of treatment What you can see is that GABODERM moves ahead of secretamab quite early and by week 4 349 of patients have achieved PASI 90 compared to just 175 of the secretamab group Any comments yet HCP Not yet please carry on HCPP The separation is maintained and significant the PValue was less than zero point zero zero one So achieves really good PASI 90 and has significant superiority to secretamab the speed of action shows separation early and is significant at week 4 and the efficacy is maintained over time as you can see No waring off Also as you can see a high percentage of patients respond excellently to GABODERM What do you think now HCP I think I think I probably should try it HCPP Thatd be great HCP So it does raise a few questions how do I prescribe and administer GABODERM and is there anything I need to be aware of You know side effects etc HCPP So ideally wed suggest using it in a biologic nave patient so you can see just how good it is and HCP Im not sure Id use it for the first time in a biologic nave patient but I do have a couple in mind whove been struggling on their current biologics HCPP Okay thats great So how to prescribe and administer HCPP Its an initial 5 doses similar to other biologics and then switching to an 8 week interval for maintenance Overall its eight less than secretamab in the first year and less on an ongoing basis which patients will love HCP Well thats easy HCPP It comes in a handy autoinjector so patients can do this themselves at home once youve trained them HCP Excellent and side effects HCPP Similar to the others apart from you may see candidiasis in up to 1 in 8 patients but its transient and can be treated with a simple antifungal In the studies we saw very few people stop treatment due to this HCP Okay that all seems very straight forward HCPP Do you have a patient in mind and how will you ensure they receive GABODERM HCP I do have someone in mind but I know theyre not due in for a couple of weeks Also although Ill see the patient itll be the nurse that administers the first dose and has responsibility for training the patient HCPP Well could we book a meeting for you to meet the nurse and ensure she has everything she needs to start that patient on GABODERM HCP Yes lets do that HCPP Excellent also its important for you to see how well GABODERM works if its going to become one of your routine treatments Could we book another meeting a couple of weeks after the patient commences treatment so we can check the patients progress I really want you to see how fast GABODERM works HCP DIARIES COMPLETED AND DATE AGREED Yes lets book that when you come in to see the nurse HCPP Excellent Ill see you then\"]",

Rep You dont know Oh lovely Theres the element of surprise there I think isnt there GP Absolutely A nice surprise Rep Yes lovely it will be Okay what I want to talk to you about today is something that I havent actually spoken to you about before and its Gaboderm methotrexate ointment and its for your moderate your adult moderate to severe eczema patients who are having frequent flares so the chances are that youll be seeing them in the practice on a regular basis GP Okay Rep Now I know that there are a few packs of Gaboderm coming out of the practice but as I say I havent spoken to you about it so Im not sure whether youre initiating it GP Im certainly not initiating it In fact I signed a script for it yesterday and I questioned whether I should be but I think we can prescribe the sort of topical one Rep Yes GP But thats the first thats the first patient Ive seen on it Rep Right okay Can I ask is there any particular reason why youre not initiating GP Its one of those yes I think we associate it with the oral methotrexate which is a scary drug But I think from our point of view its just not something thats particularly on the radar at the moment to be honest Rep When you say you associate it with oral methotrexate and being you know obviously a safety concern there is there any particular part is there any particular safety concern that is an issue for you that concerns you the most GP I think its just you know if its prescribed orally it would have to be initiated by a specialist So you know the sort of Methotrexate sort of level Rep Yes I understand your concern and you know youre not the first person to raise it but hopefully if we look at this this will reassure you And this is looking at the risk of skin cancer which I think you know has been topical recently GP Sure Rep Its a 5 year study and what they looked at was the conclusion of the study was that theres no increased risk of skin cancer associated with Gaboderm use So they dont need any other precautions other than obviously the sensible ones avoid the midday sun high sun factor that sort of thing So theres no associated risk of skin melanoma in those Gaboderm patients Weve also got another study now this is ongoing this is the Research 3 study and this is for paediatrics Its an eight year study weve got data about four years now and going back to the skin cancer again this was one case for cancer in the study population compared to an expected rate of two for the general population so for the patients not taking Gaboderm So its no greater risk in that group as well GP Sure okay Rep Does that satisfy those concerns GP Yes I mean its you know its relatively new and the sort of the whole looking at a product over the longterm isnt it so I think its one of those wed need to sort of monitor but Rep I mean I can if it would be helpful I can get you those papers GP Oh no dont please Rep Okay All right GP Unless I need something to help me sleep in the next few weeks Rep Well you might do mightnt you with a new baby coming on board GP Exactly Rep Okay what Id really like to do today then is to show you to talk about Gaboderm and for you to just to have the confidence at the end of the conversation to prescribe it in that group of patients Is that okay GP Yes go ahead Rep All right The patients that were looking at as I say are the adult patients with moderate to severe eczema Theyre flaring quite a lot so youll be seeing them on a regular basis GP Okay Rep Those are the type of patients Can you tell me currently how do you treat those patients GP I mean you tend to sort of step up your steroids and try and use ointments if you can and emollients by the bucketful and then just Rep Yes thats a really important GP I think thats probably where people tend to fall down in that theyre not often using enough of the right emollient and with that stepping up you can often sort of keep the steroids at a reasonable level Rep I mean emollient usage is key obviously they should be using that all the time There are generally sort of two ways that its eczema is treated and obviously weve covered the emollients The mild to moderate steroids and then youd consider a more potent steroid or a referral From what youve said I guess is that where you sit GP Yes thats right Rep What as I say what I want what would be useful today at the end of the call is for you to have the confidence as I say to move from that step to that step So still with the emollients still on the mild to moderate steroids but introduce Gaboderm before stepping up your steroid or a referral GP Okay Rep Okay Is there anything that you would particularly need to know from me today that as I say would give you the confidence to do that GP Its just not something Im familiar with at the moment so understanding how it well it works for patients would be useful Rep Right OK all right What Id like to show you is this study here and its a 12 month study and what it involved what it looked at was the median number of days to the first major flare that patients had There were 250 patients involved as I say a years study and the primary endpoint was the time to the first flare GP Okay Rep OK The patients were then admitted into the study all were suffering from flares They were treated with Gaboderm for up to 8 weeks before those flares were under control Once those flares were under control they were then split into two groups The first group were the Gaboderm maintenance therapy so using Gaboderm twice weekly and the second group had a vehicle ointment Is it making sense so far At the end of the year 60 of these moderate to severe eczema patients receiving the twice weekly Gaboderm were flare free for a year GP Okay Rep Compared to the other group which had their first flare at 20 days GP Okay Were they using anything as well as Gaboderm or Rep Emollients as well but nothing else GP Okay Rep So I mean how does that sound GP Yes no I mean its looks impressive from that data Rep Great OK I mean looking at the data that weve looked at already and weve hopefully satisfied your concerns about safety You seem impressed with the data there So is this now something that you would feel happier using GP Im naturally a bit slow with these things but I think Id give it a give it some thought yes Rep Right can you think of any patients that say theyre mild to moderate sorry theyre moderate to severe eczema patients sufferering who are getting the flares GP I mean the ones I can think of at the moment are probably already under control to be honest I think you know potentially if I think Im thinking of it in terms of something like Emmolixate where you know it used to be a bit scary and you get a bit of confidence with it and I would use that in certain patients now So I think you know if someone came along now I could potentially use it Rep Right great okay Because you know I mean that really is impressive there In 150 just to put it into perspective 150 days without a flare thats the entire British summer really So you know youve got days like this GP Fantastic Rep Yes exactly well probably Youve got days like this where its such lovely weather you know those patients you know if theyre going to a wedding tomorrow or something they you know theyre going to be confident that theyre not going to get a flare GP Sure sure Rep Because its you know these patients spend a third of their year in flare Its an enormous amount of time for them isnt it Okay so youre happy to prescribe it GP Yes Rep Thats great Can I just explain how it actually what the dosage is and how it works Weve got a step up and step down approach rather similar to treating asthma I guess you know they have similar approach So what happens when the patient has a flare they use Gaboderm in the evening until that flares gone And then they use Gaboderm twice a week to prevent the flares Should they have another flare then they go back to evenings until its gone and then they revert back to GP Then theyre back to twice a week Rep One thing I will point out that I think the patients need to be aware of is that when they first apply the Gaboderm they might experience a stinging or burning sensation That tends to resolve itself within 30 minutes and it only happens within the first few days of treatment So its quite important that thats pointed out because once they get past that stage they can then see the benefits it brings GP Okay fair enough Rep OK So can I come back I mean I dont know how often you see these patients and you say youve got can you think of any that you might have at the moment GP I cant think of any off the top of my head that I would initiate it with right now Rep Right okay Can I ask how often do you see patients with moderate to severe eczema that are experiencing flares GP Not that often really As I say the ones that are really bad are sort of already in the in the system Rep OK all right Well thats yes thats been I hope you found that useful GP Yes no its been helpful to know Rep Okay Ill leave you the prescribing information GP Thank you Rep Can come in and see you again when youve had a chance to try Gaboderm out GP Yes by all means Rep What day is normally the best GP Well Tuesday lunchtime is normally going to be the best way If you just ring the girls and theres a sort of slot at one ish and Rep Okay yes Providing your paternity leave GP Provided Im awake Rep Yes awake yes GP Absolutely Rep Okay thats great Ill do that GP Ok well thats brilliant Rep All right Thanks ever so much for your time GP Pleasure lovely to see you", "segments": "[\"Rep Hello GP Hi Rep How are you GP Yes not too bad thanks Not too bad Rep Good GP Come on in take a seat Rep Thanks Has your new baby arrived yet GP Any second Rep Oh no really Rep So if I have to Rep Oh gosh youre on standby then GP If I have to get up and leave then see yourself out please Rep Oh dear me So whens the due date GP Well its officially sort of two or three weeks away but it could be any well the first one was a bit early so Rep Oh right okay so this one might be as well then GP Yes Its just like waiting for a bomb to go

Rep Yes lovely it will be Okay what I want to talk to you about today is something that I havent actually spoken to you about before and its Gaboderm methotrexate ointment and its for your moderate your adult moderate to severe eczema patients who are having frequent flares so the chances are that youll be seeing them in the practice on a regular basis GP Okay Rep Now I know that there are a few packs of Gaboderm coming out of the practice but as I say I havent spoken to you about it so Im not sure whether youre initiating it GP Im certainly not initiating it In fact I signed a script for it yesterday and I questioned whether I should be but I think we can prescribe the sort of topical one Rep Yes GP But thats the first thats the first patient Ive seen on it Rep Right okay Can I ask is there any particular reason why youre not initiating GP Its one of those yes I think we associate it with the oral methotrexate which is a scary drug But I think from our point of view its just not something thats particularly on the radar at the moment to be honest Rep When you say you associate it with oral methotrexate and being you know obviously a safety concern there is there any particular part is there any particular safety concern that is an issue for you that concerns you the most GP I think its just you know if its prescribed orally it would have to be initiated by a specialist So you know the sort of Methotrexate sort of level Rep Yes I understand your concern and you know youre not the first person to raise it but hopefully if we look at this this will reassure you And this is looking at the risk of skin cancer which I think you know has been topical recently GP Sure Rep Its a 5 year study and what they looked at was the conclusion of the study was that theres no increased risk of skin cancer associated with Gaboderm use So they dont need any other precautions other than obviously the sensible ones avoid the midday sun high sun factor that sort of thing So theres no associated risk of skin melanoma in those Gaboderm patients Weve also got another study now this is ongoing this is the Research 3 study and this is for paediatrics Its an eight year study weve got data about four years now and going back to the skin cancer again this was one case for cancer in the study population compared to an expected rate of two for the general population so for the patients not taking Gaboderm So its no greater risk in that group as well GP Sure okay Rep Does that satisfy those concerns GP Yes I mean its you know its relatively new and the sort of the whole looking at a product over the longterm isnt it so I think its one of those wed need to sort of monitor but Rep I mean I can if it would be helpful I can get you those papers GP Oh no dont please Rep Okay All right GP Unless I need something to help me sleep in the next few weeks Rep Well you might do mightnt you with a new baby coming on board GP Exactly Rep Okay what Id really like to do today then is to show you to talk about Gaboderm and for you to just to have the confidence at the end of the conversation to prescribe it in that group of patients Is that okay GP Yes go ahead Rep All right The patients that were looking at as I say are the adult patients with moderate to severe eczema Theyre flaring quite a lot so youll be seeing them on a regular basis GP Okay Rep Those are the type of patients Can you tell me currently how do you treat those patients GP I mean you tend to sort of step up your steroids and try and use ointments if you can and emollients by the

gosh youre on standby then GP If I have to get up and leave then see yourself out please Rep Oh dear me So whens the due date GP Well its officially sort of two or three weeks away but it could be any well the first one was a bit early so Rep Oh right okay so this one might be as well then GP Yes Its just like waiting for a bomb to go off so Rep Oh gosh Do you know what youre having Is it a boy or a girl GP We dont know Rep You dont know Oh lovely Theres the element of surprise there I think isnt there GP Absolutely A nice surprise Rep Yes lovely it will be Okay what I want to talk to you about today is something that I havent actually spoken to you about before and its Gaboderm methotrexate ointment and its for your moderate your adult moderate to severe eczema patients who are having frequent flares so the chances are that youll be seeing them in the practice on a regular basis GP Okay Rep Now I know that there are a few packs of Gaboderm coming out of the practice but as I say I havent spoken to you about it so Im not sure whether youre initiating it GP Im certainly not initiating it In fact I signed a script for it yesterday and I questioned whether I should be but I think we can prescribe the sort of topical one Rep Yes GP But thats the first thats the first patient Ive seen on it Rep Right okay Can I ask is there any particular reason why youre not initiating GP Its one of those yes I think we associate it with the oral methotrexate which is a scary drug But I think from our point of view its just not something thats particularly on the radar at the moment to be honest Rep When you say you associate it with oral methotrexate and being you know obviously a safety concern there is there any particular part is there any particular safety concern that is an issue for you that concerns you the most GP I think its just you know if its prescribed orally it would have to be initiated by a specialist So you know the sort of Methotrexate sort of level Rep Yes I understand your concern and you know youre not the first person to raise it but hopefully if we look at this this will reassure you And this is looking at the risk of skin cancer which I think you know has been topical recently GP Sure Rep Its a 5 year study and what they looked at was the conclusion of the study was that theres no increased risk of skin cancer associated with Gaboderm use So they dont need any other precautions other than obviously the sensible ones avoid the midday sun high sun factor that sort of thing So theres no associated risk of skin melanoma in those Gaboderm patients Weve also got another study now this is ongoing this is the Research 3 study and this is for paediatrics Its an eight year study weve got data about four years now and going back to the skin cancer again this was one case for cancer in the study population compared to an expected rate of two for the general population so for the patients not taking Gaboderm So its no greater risk in that group as well GP Sure okay Rep Does that satisfy those concerns GP Yes I mean its you know its relatively new and the sort of the whole looking at a product over the longterm isnt it so I think its one of those wed need to sort of monitor but Rep I mean I can if it would be helpful I can get you those papers GP Oh no dont please Rep Okay All right GP Unless I need something to help me sleep in the next few weeks Rep Well you might do mightnt you with a new baby coming on board GP Exactly Rep Okay what Id really like to do today then is to show you to talk about Gaboderm and for you to just to have the confidence at the end of the conversation to prescribe it in that group of patients Is that okay GP Yes go ahead Rep All right The patients that were looking at as I say are the adult patients with moderate to severe eczema Theyre flaring quite a lot so youll be seeing them on a regular basis GP Okay Rep Those are the type of patients Can you tell me currently how do you treat those patients GP I mean you tend to sort of step up your steroids and try and use ointments if you can and emollients by the bucketful and then just Rep Yes thats a really important GP I think thats probably where people tend to fall down in that theyre not often using enough of the right emollient and with that stepping up you can often sort of keep the steroids at a reasonable level Rep I mean emollient usage is key obviously they should be using that all the time There are generally sort of two ways that its eczema is treated and obviously weve covered the emollients The mild to moderate steroids and then youd consider a more potent steroid or a referral From what youve said I guess is that where you sit GP Yes thats right Rep What as I say what I want what would be useful today at the end of the call is for you to have the confidence as I say to move from that step to that step So still with the emollients still on the mild to moderate steroids but introduce Gaboderm before stepping up your steroid or a referral GP Okay Rep Okay Is there anything that you would particularly need to know from me today that as I say would give you the confidence to do that GP Its just not something Im familiar with at the moment so understanding how it well it works for patients would be useful Rep Right OK all right What Id like to show you is this study here and its a 12 month study and what it involved what it looked at was the median number of days to the first major flare that patients had There were 250 patients involved as I say a years study and the primary endpoint was the time to the first flare GP Okay Rep OK The patients were then admitted into the study all were suffering from flares They were treated with Gaboderm for up to 8 weeks before those flares were under control Once those flares were under control they were then split into two groups The first group were the Gaboderm maintenance therapy so using Gaboderm twice weekly and the second group had a vehicle ointment Is it making sense so far At the end of the year 60 of these moderate to severe eczema patients receiving the twice weekly Gaboderm were flare free for a year GP Okay Rep Compared to the other group which had their first flare at 20 days GP Okay Were they using anything as well as Gaboderm or Rep Emollients as well but nothing else GP Okay Rep So I mean how does that sound GP Yes no I mean its looks impressive from that data Rep Great OK I mean looking at the data that weve looked at already and weve hopefully satisfied your concerns about safety You seem impressed with the data there So is this now something that you would feel happier using GP Im naturally a bit slow with these things but I think Id give it a give it some thought yes Rep Right can you think of any patients that say theyre mild to moderate sorry theyre moderate to severe eczema patients sufferering who are getting the flares GP I mean the ones I can think of at the moment are probably already under control to be honest I think you know potentially if I think Im thinking of it in terms of something like Emmolixate where you know it used to be a bit scary and you get a bit of confidence with it and I would use that in certain patients now So I think you know if someone came along now I could potentially use it Rep Right great okay Because you know I mean that really is impressive there In 150 just to put it into perspective 150 days without a flare thats the entire British summer really So you know youve got days like this GP Fantastic Rep Yes exactly well probably Youve got days like this where its such lovely weather you know those patients you know if theyre going to a wedding tomorrow or something they you know theyre going to be confident that theyre not going to get a flare GP Sure sure Rep Because its you know these patients spend a third of their year in flare Its an enormous amount of time for them isnt it Okay so youre happy to prescribe it GP Yes Rep Thats great Can I just explain how it actually what the dosage is and how it works Weve got a step up and step down approach rather similar to treating asthma I guess you know they have similar approach So what happens when the patient has a flare they use Gaboderm in the evening until that flares gone And then they use Gaboderm twice a week to prevent the flares Should they have another flare then they go back to evenings until its gone and then they revert back to GP Then theyre back to twice a week Rep One thing I will point out that I think the patients need to be aware of is that when they first apply the Gaboderm they might experience a stinging or burning sensation That tends to resolve itself within 30 minutes and it only happens within the first few days of treatment So its quite important that thats pointed out because once they get past that stage they can then see the benefits it brings GP Okay fair enough Rep OK So can I come back I mean I dont know how often you see these patients and you say youve got can you think of any that you might have at the moment GP I cant think of any off the top of my head that I would initiate it with right now Rep Right okay Can I ask how often do you see patients with moderate to severe eczema that are experiencing flares GP Not that often really As I say the ones that are really bad are sort of already in the in the system Rep OK all right Well thats yes thats been I hope you found that useful GP Yes no its been helpful to know Rep Okay Ill leave you the prescribing information GP Thank you Rep Can come in and see you again when youve had a chance to try Gaboderm out GP Yes by all means Rep What day is normally the best GP Well Tuesday lunchtime is normally going to be the best way If you just ring the girls and theres a sort of slot at one ish and Rep Okay yes Providing your paternity leave GP Provided Im awake Rep Yes awake yes GP Absolutely Rep Okay thats great Ill do that GP Ok well thats brilliant Rep All right Thanks

the user guide so its available for both nurse and patients both in paper and electronic form and we would show this in training for your team And you can see here gestures to next page on iPad this is how the layers work together You have the confidence that it will give you that same high quality wound care that you have become used to with Liquifil and in addition you have a skin friendly and gentle contact area that will give minimal pain on removal and consistent protection for up to a week And it comes in the normal selection of sizes and as it can be cut to shape it is very flexible and can be used on many different body areas So you have that simplicity you were talking about you dont have so think too much about is this the right dressing or not because it is so flexible in its

GP Any second Rep Oh no really Rep So if I have to Rep Oh gosh youre on standby then GP If I have to get up and leave then see yourself out please Rep Oh dear me So whens the due date GP Well its officially sort of two or three weeks away but it could be any well the first one was a bit early so Rep Oh right okay so this one might be as well then GP Yes Its just like waiting for a bomb to go off so Rep Oh gosh Do you know what youre having Is it a boy or a girl GP We dont know Rep You dont know Oh lovely Theres the element of surprise there I think isnt there GP Absolutely A nice surprise Rep Yes lovely it will be Okay what I want to talk to you about today is something that I havent actually spoken to you about before and its Gaboderm methotrexate ointment and its for your moderate your adult moderate to severe eczema patients who are having frequent flares so the chances are that youll be seeing them in the practice on a regular basis GP Okay Rep Now I know that there are a few packs of Gaboderm coming out of the practice but as I say I havent spoken to you about it so Im not sure whether youre initiating it GP Im certainly not initiating it In fact I signed a script for it yesterday and I questioned whether I should be but I think we can prescribe the sort of topical one Rep Yes GP But thats the first thats the first patient Ive seen on it Rep Right okay Can I ask is there any particular reason why youre not initiating GP Its one of those yes I think we associate it with the oral methotrexate which is a scary drug But I think from our point of view its just not something thats particularly on the radar at the moment to be honest Rep When you say you associate it with oral methotrexate and being you know obviously a safety concern there is there any particular part is there any particular safety concern that is an issue for you that concerns you the most GP I think its just you know if its prescribed orally it would have to be initiated by a specialist So you know the sort of Methotrexate sort of level Rep Yes I understand your concern and you know youre not the first person to raise it but hopefully if we look at this this will reassure you And this is looking at the risk of skin cancer which I think you know has been topical recently GP Sure Rep Its a 5 year study and what they looked at was the conclusion of the study was that theres no increased risk of skin cancer associated with Gaboderm use So they dont need any other precautions other than obviously the sensible ones avoid the midday sun high sun factor that sort of thing So theres no associated risk of skin melanoma in those Gaboderm patients Weve also got another study now this is ongoing this is the Research 3 study and this is for paediatrics Its an eight year study weve got data about four years now and going back to the skin cancer again this was one case for cancer in the study population compared to an expected rate of two for the general population so for the patients not taking Gaboderm So its no greater risk in that group as well GP Sure okay Rep Does that satisfy those concerns GP Yes I mean its you know its relatively new and the sort of the whole looking at a product over the longterm isnt it so I think its one of those wed need to sort of monitor but Rep I mean I can if it would be helpful I can get you those papers GP Oh no dont please Rep Okay All right GP Unless I need something to help me sleep in the next few weeks Rep Well you might do mightnt you with a new baby coming on board GP Exactly Rep Okay what Id really like to do today then is to show you to talk about Gaboderm and for you to just to have the confidence at the end of the conversation to prescribe it in that group of patients Is that okay GP Yes go ahead Rep All right The patients that were looking at as I say are the adult patients with moderate to severe eczema Theyre flaring quite a lot so youll be seeing them on a regular basis GP Okay Rep Those are the type of patients Can you tell me currently how do you treat those patients GP I mean you tend to sort of step up your steroids and try and use ointments if you can and emollients by the bucketful and then just Rep Yes thats a really important GP I think thats probably where people tend to fall down in that theyre not often using enough of the right emollient and with that stepping up you can often sort of keep the steroids at a reasonable level Rep I mean emollient usage is key obviously they should be using that all the time There are generally sort of two ways that its eczema is treated and obviously weve covered the emollients The mild to moderate steroids and then youd consider a more potent steroid or a referral From what youve said I guess is that where you sit GP Yes thats right Rep What as I say what I want what would be useful today at the end of the call is for you to have the confidence as I say to move from that step to that step So still with the emollients still on the mild to moderate steroids but introduce Gaboderm before stepping up your steroid or a referral GP Okay Rep Okay Is there anything that you would particularly need to know from me today that as I say would give you the confidence to do that GP Its just not something Im familiar with at the moment so understanding how it well it works for patients would be useful Rep Right OK all right What Id like to show you is this study here and its a 12 month study and what it involved what it looked at was the median number of days to the first major flare that patients had There were 250 patients involved as I say a years study and the primary endpoint was the time to the first flare GP Okay Rep OK The patients were then admitted into the study all were suffering from flares They were treated with Gaboderm for up to 8 weeks before those flares were under control Once those flares were under control they were then split into two groups The first group were the Gaboderm maintenance therapy so using Gaboderm twice weekly and the second group had a vehicle ointment Is it making sense so far At the end of the year 60 of these moderate to severe eczema patients receiving the twice weekly Gaboderm were flare free for a year GP Okay Rep Compared to the other group which had their first flare at 20 days GP Okay Were they using anything as well as Gaboderm or Rep Emollients as well but nothing else GP Okay Rep So I mean how does that sound GP Yes no I mean its looks impressive from that data Rep Great OK I mean looking at the data that weve looked at already and weve hopefully satisfied your concerns about safety You seem impressed with the data there So is this now something that you would feel happier using GP Im naturally a bit slow with these things but I think Id give it a give it some thought yes Rep Right can you think of any patients that say theyre mild to moderate sorry theyre moderate to severe eczema patients sufferering who are getting the flares GP I mean the ones I can think of at the moment are probably already under control to be honest I think you know potentially if I think Im thinking of it in terms of something like Emmolixate where you know it used to be a bit scary and you get a bit of confidence with it and I would use that in certain patients now So I think you know if someone came along now I could potentially use it Rep Right great okay Because you know I mean that really is impressive there In 150 just to put it into perspective 150 days without a flare thats the entire British summer really So you know youve got days like this GP Fantastic Rep Yes exactly well probably Youve got days like this where its such lovely weather you know those patients you know if theyre going to a wedding tomorrow or something they you know theyre going to be confident that theyre not going to get a flare GP Sure sure Rep Because its you know these patients spend a third of their year in flare Its an enormous amount of time for them isnt it Okay so youre happy to prescribe it GP Yes Rep Thats great Can I just explain how it actually what the dosage is and how it works Weve got a step up and step down approach rather similar to treating asthma I guess you know they have similar approach So what happens when the patient has a flare they use Gaboderm in the evening until that flares gone And then they use Gaboderm twice a week to prevent the flares Should they have another flare then they go back to evenings until its gone and then they revert back to GP Then theyre back to twice a week Rep One thing I will point out that I think the patients need to be aware of is that when they first apply the Gaboderm they might experience a stinging or burning sensation That tends to resolve itself within 30 minutes and it only happens within the first few days of treatment So its quite important that thats pointed out because once they get past that stage they can then see the benefits it brings GP Okay fair enough Rep OK So can I come back I mean I dont know how often you see these patients and you say youve got can you think of any that you might have at the moment GP I cant think of any off the top of my head that I would initiate it with right now Rep Right okay Can I ask how often do you see patients with moderate to severe eczema that are experiencing flares GP Not that often really As I say the ones that are really bad are sort of already in the in the system Rep OK all right Well thats yes thats been I hope you found that useful GP Yes no its been helpful to know Rep Okay Ill leave you the prescribing information GP Thank you Rep Can come in and see you again when youve had a chance to try Gaboderm out GP Yes by all means Rep What day is normally the best GP Well Tuesday lunchtime is normally going to be the best way If you just ring the girls and theres a sort of slot at one ish and Rep Okay yes Providing your paternity leave GP Provided Im awake Rep Yes awake yes GP Absolutely Rep Okay thats great Ill do that GP Ok well thats brilliant Rep All right Thanks ever so much for your time GP Pleasure lovely to see you", "levelDone": true}}, {"model":

this in training for your team And you can see here gestures to next page on iPad this is how the layers work together You have the confidence that it will give you that same high quality wound care that you have become used to with Liquifil and in addition you have a skin friendly and gentle contact area that will give minimal pain on removal and consistent protection for up to a week And it

so think too much about is this the right dressing or not because it is so flexible in its use I would suggest that to identify the right patient think Are you needing to ensure good vertical wicking for exudate and do they need the extra protection of a foam dressing If the answer is yes then use CombiClean Foam"}}, {"model": "analysis.finalstatementwithlevel", "pk": 1262, "fields":

seat Rep Thanks Has your new baby arrived yet GP Any second Rep Oh no really Rep So if I have to Rep Oh gosh youre on standby then GP If I have to get up and leave then see yourself out please Rep Oh dear me So whens the due date GP Well its officially sort of two or three weeks away but it could be any well the first one was a bit early so Rep Oh right okay so this one might be as well then GP Yes Its just like waiting for a bomb to go off so Rep Oh gosh Do you know what youre having Is it a boy or a girl GP We dont know Rep You dont know Oh lovely Theres the element of surprise there I think isnt there GP Absolutely A nice surprise Rep Yes lovely it will be Okay what I want to talk to you about today is something that I havent actually spoken to you about before and its Gaboderm methotrexate ointment and its for your moderate your adult moderate to severe eczema patients who are having frequent flares so the chances are that youll be seeing them in the practice on a regular basis GP Okay Rep Now I know that there are a few packs of Gaboderm coming out of the practice but as I say I havent spoken to you about it so Im not sure whether youre initiating it GP Im certainly not initiating it In fact I signed a script for it yesterday and I questioned whether I should be but I think we can prescribe the sort of topical one Rep Yes GP But thats the first thats the first patient Ive seen on it Rep Right okay Can I ask is there any particular reason why youre not initiating GP Its one of those yes I think we associate it with the oral methotrexate which is a scary drug But I think from our point of view its just not something thats particularly on the radar at the moment to be honest Rep When you say you associate it with oral methotrexate and being you know obviously a safety concern there is there any particular part is there any particular safety concern that is an issue for you that concerns you the most GP I think its just you know if its prescribed orally it would have to be initiated by a specialist So you know the sort of Methotrexate sort of level Rep Yes I understand your concern and you know youre not the first person to raise it but hopefully if we look at this this will reassure you And this is looking at the risk of skin cancer which I think you know has been topical recently GP Sure Rep Its a 5 year study and what they looked at was the conclusion of the study was that theres no increased risk of skin cancer associated with Gaboderm use So they dont need any other precautions other than obviously the sensible ones avoid the midday sun high sun factor that sort of thing So theres no associated risk of skin melanoma in those Gaboderm patients Weve also got another study now this is ongoing this is the Research 3 study and this is for paediatrics Its an eight year study weve got data about four years now and going back to the skin cancer again this was one case for cancer in the study population compared to an expected rate of two for the general population so for the patients not taking Gaboderm So its no greater risk in that group as well GP Sure okay Rep Does that satisfy those concerns GP Yes I mean its you know its relatively new and the sort of the whole looking at a product over the longterm isnt it so I think its one of those wed need to sort of monitor but Rep I mean I can if it would be helpful I can get you those papers GP Oh no dont please Rep Okay All right GP Unless I need something to help me sleep in the next few weeks Rep Well you might do mightnt you with a new baby coming on board GP Exactly Rep Okay what Id really like to do today then is to show you to talk about Gaboderm and for you to just to have the confidence at the end of the conversation to prescribe it in that group of patients Is that okay GP Yes go ahead Rep All right The patients that were looking at as I say are the adult patients with moderate to severe eczema Theyre flaring quite a lot so youll be seeing them on a regular basis GP Okay Rep Those are the type of patients Can you tell me currently how do you treat those patients GP I mean you tend to sort of step up your steroids and try and use ointments if you can and emollients by the bucketful and then just Rep Yes thats a really important GP I think thats probably where people tend to fall down in that theyre not often using enough of the right emollient and with that stepping up you can often sort of keep the steroids at a reasonable level Rep I mean emollient usage is key obviously they should be using that all the time There are generally sort of two ways that its eczema is treated and obviously weve covered the emollients The mild to moderate steroids and then youd consider a more potent steroid or a referral From what youve said I guess is that where you sit GP Yes thats right Rep What as I say what I want what would be useful today at the end of the call is for you to have the confidence as I say to move from that step to that step So still with the emollients still on the mild to moderate steroids but introduce Gaboderm before stepping up your steroid or a referral GP Okay Rep Okay Is there anything that you would particularly need to know from me today that as I say would give you the confidence to do that GP Its just not something Im familiar with at the moment so understanding how it well it works for patients would be useful Rep Right OK all right What Id like to show you is this study here and its a 12 month study and what it involved what it looked at was the median number of days to the first major flare that patients had There were 250 patients involved as I say a years study and the primary endpoint was the time to the first flare GP Okay Rep OK The patients were then admitted into the study all were suffering from flares They were treated with Gaboderm for up to 8 weeks before those flares were under control Once those flares were under control they were then split into two groups The first group were the Gaboderm maintenance therapy so using Gaboderm twice weekly and the second group had a vehicle ointment Is it making sense so far At the end of the year 60 of these moderate to severe eczema patients receiving the twice weekly Gaboderm were flare free for a year GP Okay Rep Compared to the other group which had their first flare at 20 days GP Okay Were they using anything as well as Gaboderm or Rep Emollients as well but nothing else GP Okay Rep So I mean how does that sound GP Yes no I mean its looks impressive from that data Rep Great OK I mean looking at the data that weve looked at already and weve hopefully satisfied your concerns about safety You seem impressed with the data there So is this now something that you would feel happier using GP Im naturally a bit slow with these things but I think Id give it a give it some thought yes Rep Right can you think of any patients that say theyre mild to moderate sorry theyre moderate to severe eczema patients sufferering who are getting the flares GP I mean the ones I can think of at the moment are probably already under control to be honest I think you know potentially if I think Im thinking of it in terms of something like Emmolixate where you know it used to be a bit scary and you get a bit of confidence with it and I would use that in certain patients now So I think you know if someone came along now I could potentially use it Rep Right great okay Because you know I mean that really is impressive there In 150 just to put it into perspective 150 days without a flare thats the entire British summer really So you know youve got days like this GP Fantastic Rep Yes exactly well probably Youve got days like this where its such lovely weather you know those patients you know if theyre going to a wedding tomorrow or something they you know theyre going to be confident that theyre not going to get a flare GP Sure sure Rep Because its you know these patients spend a third of their year in flare Its an enormous amount of time for them isnt it Okay so youre happy to prescribe it GP Yes Rep Thats great Can I just explain how it actually what the dosage is and how it works Weve got a step up and step down approach rather similar to treating asthma I guess you know they have similar approach So what happens when the patient has a flare they use Gaboderm in the evening until that flares gone And then they use Gaboderm twice a week to prevent the flares Should they have another flare then they go back to evenings until its gone and then they revert back to GP Then theyre back to twice a week Rep One thing I will point out that I think the patients need to be aware of is that when they first apply the Gaboderm they might experience a stinging or burning sensation That tends to resolve itself within 30 minutes and it only happens within the first few days of treatment So its quite important that thats pointed out because once they get past that stage they can then see the benefits it brings GP Okay fair enough Rep OK So can I come back I mean I dont know how often you see these patients and you say youve got can you think of any that you might have at the moment GP I cant think of any off the top of my head that I would initiate it with right now Rep Right okay Can I ask how often do you see patients with moderate to severe eczema that are experiencing flares GP Not that often really As I say the ones that are really bad are sort of already in the in the system Rep OK all right Well thats yes thats been I hope you found that useful GP Yes no its been helpful to know Rep Okay Ill leave you the prescribing information GP Thank you Rep Can come in and see you again when youve had a chance to try Gaboderm out GP Yes by all means Rep What day is normally the best GP Well Tuesday lunchtime is normally going to be the best way If you just ring the girls and theres a sort of slot at one ish and Rep Okay yes Providing your paternity leave GP Provided Im awake Rep Yes awake yes GP Absolutely Rep Okay thats great Ill do that GP Ok well thats brilliant Rep All right Thanks ever so much for your time GP Pleasure lovely to see you"}}, {"model":
